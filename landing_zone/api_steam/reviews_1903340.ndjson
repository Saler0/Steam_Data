Incredibly strong start with a unique sense of visual and audio identity. I've never played a game that quite looked or sounded like this, probably aided by it's French origins. There's a strange ethereal sense to the entire world that keeps every area so distinct it's breath taking. The set up for the story and our characters is also quite striking and subdued. A lot of great \"show don't tell\". Also glad the game was not scared of killing off characters, shocking yet narratively satisfying. It really goes for what it wants when it wants to.\n\nGameplay wise I think the game is exactly as long as it should be without the side content. With the side content, if I didn't min max as much as autistically possible I probably would have thrown the controller at the wall. Honestly a lot of the average side bosses had over 10000x times the HP of the final boss of the story, so once you get to Act 3, if you're not loving the game, just go directly for the end.\n\nI do enjoy how the game really let you dig into glass cannon builds. It's how I enjoyed most it, just setting my characters up so that they killed the enemy within the first two turns. It's fun exploring like this, especially when you go from oneshotting to hitting only a fifth of the enemies health. The wake up calls just became another part of the fun. Alternatively, there's also fun when you're putting out shit damage and you still manage by learning good parry timings. There's a wide range of viable options, at least at standard difficulty. I think the game would be profoundly unfun once parries are mandatory.\n\nI think the game is worth it based on these facts alone. The devs treated JRPG conventions with taste and love that really drives home they care about them. That love shines through, however, I don't think it was a perfect masterpiece by any means. It's got a couple flaws. \n\nAs far as critiques go, I feel the game couldn't decide if it wanted to be a JRPG or a Dark Souls game from a narrative standpoint. There's a lot of things just left oddly unstated and there was a constant feeling that I missed a conversation somewhere when characters talked. On the other hand, they went hand over fist on the bonding between party members, which feels like the game is getting dragged in two different directions story wise. This only really stops being a problem when all is revealed but at that point there's less than an hour of story, which makes it a moot point.\n\nThere's a lot of characters that just sorta, fell flat for me? Like there's a couple of big moments that are set up as huge emotional and thematic breakthroughs and... there's no real build up to it? This is what I mean by the game can't decide if it's Dark Souls or a JRPG. It wants the huge thematic breakthroughs of knowing a character's psychology deeply, but fails to actually explain or explore said psychology beforehand. It's explained afterwards but that's kind of unfun.\n\nI'll say it's combat menus were a bit derivative of Persona 5, but I guess if you're going to copy someone else's homework, might as well be a good game. I guess that also somewhat applies to the idea of just overtly stated bond levels in general, very persona-esque as well. \n\nI've seen some people complain that the ending of the story is a downer and really crushes the themes of \"optimism in the face of despair\" and \"sacrificing for those that follow\". I get why someone would take that interpretation away from it, but I feel like how the final Act plays out perfectly encapsulates the themes that were explored earlier in the story. It's a story about grieving and loss and about how it effects us, basically every aspect of the story revolves around this. Admittedly it's a bit of a downer, but that's because it's a story about broken people and what broke them.\n\nFun game, never want to play a game like it again/10", "timestamp_created": 1749841326, "timestamp_updated": 1749841326, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

I play both AAA titles, Indies, some little stupid fun games, competitives, RPG, story-driven, strategy, platformers, action, chill, difficult, you name it. On lookout for this \"special something\" in games only they can deliver as they are, for me, books you can interact with.\r\n\r\nI've never done a review, but I feel obliged to share this wonderful experience I just had.\r\n\r\nThe game is an [u] absolute masterpiece [/u], it stretches the boundaries of the medium which is a video game on so many levels.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely beautiful locations, you can feel the love poured into them at every step through the game. Each one is different and so damn well thought out and performed. Very early in the game I had a \"well, this is a wallpaper material\" moment. Those turned out to occur quite often throughout the game. But to be frank, I wouldn't mind having some of them framed on my wall.\r\n\r\nThe Music is hands down the best OST of a video game I've ever heard. So many different pieces and each and every one of them is so good it just sweeps you away into this world on a journey you'll never forget.\r\n\r\nThe Story is so original, captivating, powerful, charming, keeping you on edge and guessing, from beginning till the end. You feel like you're in there with the characters sharing their difficulties and hopes. Sometimes silly, sometimes dead serious.\r\n\r\nBut what makes this, in my opinion, one of the best games released last decade is the marriage of all the 3:\r\n\r\nAdmiring breathtaking locations, on an absolutely captivating journey you're emotionally invested in, you're being catapulted into the god realm by the music.\r\n\r\nThe story, visuals, music and your emotions all dance in union on a deep level. This is truly a work of art.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most impressive aspect of the game for me. The way they knew how to connect visuals with music and events in gameplay and the Story to create this wonderful feeling of just beautiful synergy, pulling you in along with you.\r\n\r\nI'm purposefully leaving out the actual gameplay (which is a breath of fresh air, fun and rewarding) to put the emphasis on different aspects.\r\n\r\nNever in a video game had I so many moments of sheer joy, admiration for concept and attention to detail, moments of \"just WOW....\" and just taking in what's happening.\r\n\r\nI want to thank the devs for creating this and express my gratitude.

After about 100 hours and 2 complete playthroughs I can say this game was worth every second and $ I invested. I loved the game so much I bought the deluxe cosmetics add-on just so I could support Sandfall even further. I never even changed the default skins of any character in either of my playthroughs.\n\nEven if you are unsure, I would strongly recommend playing this game. Even if it’s just to support a small dev who created a fun, worthwhile video game like how video games use to be before AAA studios just shoved content at their consumers without any care of its quality.\n\nSandfall is definitely on my radar and I can’t wait to see what comes next.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n[b]Story:[/b] Great original story that hits you right in the feels. The dialog sounds like it was written by a human who knows what humans sound like! Shocking, in today’s gaming world. The voice acting (English) is phenomenal and worth all the praise it has been receiving. Music *chef’s kiss*, it’s now one of my go-to OSTs while doing things around the house. I enjoyed every character and loved getting to know them and listen to what they had to say instead of mashing skip to move on.\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b] This game brought me back to when I played FF7 forever ago. The Lumina / Picto system is very FF7. I didn’t mind the QTE casting system (you can turn it off in settings) and the Dodge, Parry, G.Parry and Jump mechanics didn’t ruffle my feathers. There are so many weapons and pictos that you can really make a million different builds and team comps. And yes, there are OP meta builds for sure but I have created several non-meta builds and everything works just fine if done correctly and can clear game content.\n\n[b]Visuals:[/b] Yes, just yes. Thank you Sandfall for giving us a beautiful game to look at.\n\n[b]Performance:[/b] I have an older rig so once I got settings and visuals to be happy running 60+ fps, the game was smooth as butter. 100 hours of gameplay and I only had one crash and maybe a handful of stutters, that’s it! Great for a game running on UE5.\n", "timestamp_created": 1749827869, "timestamp_updated": 1749827869, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Play this game, stop reading this and buy it!\r\n\r\nIf you are still reading, let me hit you with some high points:\r\nThe main cast feel like real people.  Not just written like real people, but voice acted, animated, and portrayed as real people. You can still mess with this by putting them in swimsuits, but even that still feels somehow in character at times.\r\nThe story is ABOUT something. I won't talk about what right now to remain spoiler free, but the themes of the game bleed into EVERY aspect of it. I will say something that shouldn't be a spoiler, but Clair-Obscur means light and dark, but specifically references a painting technique.  This clever title spells out the themes of the game perfectly, and 60 hours in, I'm still blown away by the meaning behind it all.\r\nThe combat is engaging.  Like many RPGs, there are ways to \"solve\" encounters, and certainly you can become so overpowered that combat stops being challenging, but for the majority of the game time, the combat is both entertaining, challenging, and interesting.  Your character builds are also very meaningful. Don't feel too attached to the Attribute points, but pay VERY close attention to your Pictos and Lumina. Getting good at dodging is recommended, but not fully required outside of a few, very very specific fights (which you can still obviate by avoiding and coming back for).\r\n\r\nThis game is a 10/10.

The game dares to blend traditional turn-based tactics with real-time action elements, resulting in an experience as emotionally charged as it is mechanically inventive.\n\nInnovative Gameplay and Combat\nAt its core, Expedition 33 reinvents tactical combat by merging strategic turn-based decision-making with the immediacy of real-time dodging, parrying, and timed counterattacks. Each battle feels like a finely choreographed duel where every action matters. Players must balance careful planning with the burst of adrenaline that comes from rapid reflex encounters—especially when facing off against formidable foes whose attacks demand precision and timing. This dynamic system challenges you to rethink your approach at every turn, transforming routine skirmishes into masterclasses of strategy and reaction.\n\nGripping Narrative and Deep World-Building\nThe storytelling in Expedition 33 is as atmospheric as its gameplay. Set against the haunting backdrop of a world clinging to its last vestiges of hope, the narrative weaves a tale of inevitable loss and heart-wrenching determination. You lead Expedition 33—a final, desperate mission against an otherworldly force that has haunted humanity for decades. While the premise may sound fantastical—a countdown to doom with every expedition carrying the weight of destiny—the game grounds its lore in relatable human emotion and moral complexity. The character interactions, evolving party dynamics, and subtle revelations gradually draw you into a story where every loss and triumph feels consequential.\n\nAesthetic Brilliance and Immersive Presentation\nVisually, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a work of art. The game marries French Baroque elegance with the gritty decay of a fallen epoch, creating environments that are as haunting as they are beautiful. From intricately designed landscapes to character animations steeped in dramatic flair, every detail contributes to an overarching atmosphere of melancholy and resolve. The soundtrack and ambient soundscapes further heighten the experience, seamlessly transitioning between moments of high-octane action and reflective calm .\n\nMinor Quibbles and Overall Impact\nNo game is without its imperfections. Some players might find the main story a bit on the shorter side—hovering around a tight 30 hours—and a few enemy encounters can feel overly dense amidst the relentless action. However, these are small blemishes on an otherwise groundbreaking experience that pushes the envelope of what turn-based combat can achieve. With robust post-launch support and community-driven adjustments (like the much-anticipated rematch options for challenging boss encounters), Sandfall Interactive has shown a commitment to refining an already exceptional game.\n\nConclusion\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33 stands out as a revolutionary title that fuses traditional JRPG elements with innovative real-time mechanics. It offers a richly detailed world, a stirring narrative of survival, and combat that demands both thoughtfulness and quick reflexes. For anyone passionate about games that challenge conventional boundaries and evoke deep emotional responses, this title is an absolute must-play.\n\nImagine exploring a beautifully decaying world where every tactical decision could mean the difference between hope and oblivion.

It’s rare to find a game that pulls you in this deeply. I never skipped a single cutscene\n\nThe battle system is another highlight; interactive and just plain fun. It strikes the perfect balance between strategy and action, keeping you engaged at every turn.\n\nThe soundtracks.. it’s a solid 11/10. The music elevates every scene and battle, adding layers of emotion and atmosphere that few games manage to capture.\n\nVisually, the game is absolutely stunning. The world, the character design, the lighting – everything is crafted with care.\n\nIf you're even remotely thinking about picking this up, do it.

Rich, mature, emotional, layered with symbolism, and with heart wrenching ending no matter what you do. Won't go into details as I do not want to spoil anything. I wish I could erase my memory so I could experience it for the first time again.\nThe characters are explicit, interesting, charismatic, have a soul, motivation, and are relatable.\nThe voice acting is top-tier.\nThere are many journal entries which give insight to the world lore - really help to get into the lore if you are interested.\nBonus points for not shoving in any political correctness (looking at you Dragon Age: Queerguard).\n\n[h3] ZA WARUDO [/h3]\nThe world and locations are absolutely stunning. I like the world exploration progression -new parts of the map are unlocked as you progress through the main story. However, the locations can vary in difficulty a lot so it can be hard to orient yourself and know which location you should go to next and you often stumble into location that is over you level, or alternatively you 1shot everything, unless you use a guide (shout out to the chads you make steam guides). \nThe map on the continent is fine, however, there is no map in the various locations. The visuals are absolutely gorgeous, but it is sometimes a difficult to navigate without map. I wish they'd add this. \n\n[h3] COMBAT [/h3]\nMixing turn-based combat with soul-like elements such as dodging and parrying works (at least for me) surprisingly well. It's something new and unusual - a breath of fresh air. The combat is often difficult as it requires successful dodging/ parrying, so I guess people can get frustrated. Each member of your party has unique mechanics and skills - which I absolutely LOVE! I love the fact that with proper build (and it is not even that difficult to make without looking at any guides) you can 1shot even the most difficult bosses (in the last act ONLY!)\n\n[h3] SOUNDTRACK [/h3]\nAbsolute eargasm. One of the best game soundtracks out there. Funnily enough, it was made by a guy who has never made game music, whom the developers found a random forum, lol.\n\n[h3] SUMMARY [/h3]\n9.8 / 10\nI miss the option to make game saves, locations could use map. Some of the optional minigames were made by the Devil himself.\nExcept for these minor convenience issues, a perfect game.\n\n If this game does not win GOTY I will riot.\n\nA masterclass in writing.\n'I envy them, those who can't see.

Still...\n\n[h1]Is this a good game?[/h1]\nUndeniably, yes! Go, get it, now!\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nExcellent, original, moving. There are some excellent, timeless themes here and this game will be just as gripping in 10 or 20 years as it is today. It's about grief. It's about loss. It's about family (and how complicated family can be). All of that told with an excellent, gripping and unique script, with a fantastical premise.\n\nOh, and just in case you've heard from some clowns that the game is \"woke\" - no, it's not.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nFor a AA game the visuals are just fantastic.\n\nThe main characters are detailed and well animated. The locations are unique and just... gorgeous. And there's plenty of environmental storytelling as well, with little details sprinkled here or there. There's an aura of surrealism surrounding every location or character, quite deliberate in tone and style, and it all fits so perfectly together. Almost... like a painting (which is a recurring theme).\n\nMost of the cutscenes are in-engine (there are but a handful of pre-rendered videos), so your character customizations will likely make it into the main story beats (which, depending on the chosen customizations, can make things look a bit goofy but that's your own fault then).\n\nAnd it all runs very smooth too on the Unreal Engine! If there's one minor nitpick it would be the slight overuse of FoV effects. Thankfully this can be modded out on the PC. Actually, because this is a UE game mods are bound to be quite common, so there's a good chance that anything particularly irksome will get modded.\n\n[h1]Music and sound[/h1]\nI can't say it \"slaps\" or \"rocks\" because those words wouldn't \"fit\". But the music is absolutely phenomenal. The songs feel as unique as the game itself. The OST is well worth a listen.\n\nIt's also worth noting that all of the main characters are fully voiced, and the voice actors delivered FANTASIC performances. If there's anything here to pick it's that side characters aren't \"voiced\", at least not in the traditional sense. They'll make sounds when they talk but reading captions is required to understand them.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nIt's a old-school inspired Final Fantasy-like turn-based RPG, with an additional action-timed component for attacks (optionally can be turned off if you like) and a dodge/parry/other system for defence (this system cannot be turned off, but is adjusted according to the selected difficulty). There's also a hefty dose of exploration (which is pretty typical for this kind of RPG game), meaning extra items can be found hidden behind nooks and corners.\n\n[h1]Generic nitpicking[/h1]\nThese are very \"nitpicky\" things, that didn't deter from my enjoyment of the game. YMMV so if something sounds like it'll be very irksome then maybe take a longer ponder about getting the game, otherwise ignore this section entirely.\n\n- While I can certainly see the appeal behind the dodge/parry system, which breaks up the monotony of just clicking the same things over and over, it really feels oddly implemented at times. For one, I can't really tell if the game is well balanced or not, because successful parries and dodges effectively nullify all damage taken. On the other hand the enemy attack animations are sometimes a bit over the top in terms of wind-up and delivery, clearly made to throw the timing \"off\" to increase the difficulty\n- The UI is a bit clunky, especially later in the game when the player has a lot of items then scrolling the various lists becomes a bit tedious and somewhat annoying\n- The game doesn't really show enemy levels; it's possible to wander into a fight for which the player is completely not prepared, which will likely send them back to the last save point\n- There are a few mini-games and those felt a bit tacked on. On the one hand it was a nice break from the typical pacing of the game, but some of the games felt a bit more frustrating than others (the \"volleyball\" minigame in particular)\n- There's a wee bit of \"jankiness\" to the environments; while they're always beautiful to look at, characters can get stuck on geometry. I never got \"permastuck\"; at worst I'd be held back by a slight curve I'd need to jump over.\n- Outside of the \"overworld\" the game has no mini-map of any sort when exploring specific locations, and the level of detail of those locations means it's sometimes difficult to tell what is a valid route and what is just a set of decorative rocks. The levels are also rarely straightforward, meaning it's possible to get lost in them. It's by no means a showstopper, but I did get turned around on a few occasions.\n- The lip-syncing is... meh. It's not tragic but could be better.\n\n[h1]Closing thoughts[/h1]\nIn a world where 70 and 80 USD/EUR games are becoming normalized (and then come with extra monetization and other BS to boot) this game is a stellar, shining beacon of what games should be. It's smart, it's unique, it's pretty, it's engaging, it's got plenty of content, and it's very well priced.\n\nI sincerely hope we get more games like this one, and less overpriced \"quadruple A\" slop.", "timestamp_created": 1749816692, "timestamp_updated": 1749838301, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

The story has many twists and turns, most of them make sense and carry a lot of emotional weight. I love the setting as well, it's like a combination of fin de siècle / belle epoque with a twisted fairytale world. There are many layers to the story and the game rewards thorough exploration with additional lore bits.\n\n[h3]STRUCTURE[/h3]\nIt's a 3 act game, each act comes with unique gameplay elements and challenges. There's an \"overworld\" map that gets progressively easier to explore. The game railroads players through the first 2 acts - then it opens up completely which feels a bit imbalanced, but in my opinion, it's okay. There are many cool locations to discover and there even are some post-story challenge levels which is a nice touch. \n\n[h3]CHARACTERS[/h3]\nThis is where the game truly shines. I don't want to spoil anything, but in general, it's a game about grief. To be more precise, it's an exploration of how grief affects a family. The characters are believable and well written, I really liked the dialogues. The voice acting is stellar as well. The game is linear when it comes to its story, so don't expect branching narrative. \n\n[h3]COMBAT[/h3]\nI'm not a JRPG player, but this game has sparked some interest in the genre. The combat is turn based, but there's an action element (dodge / parry, QTEs) which feels really rewarding once you get the hang of it. The party consists of 5 characters, 3 of them can fight at the same time. Each character has a completely unique set of skills. It's fun to tinker with different builds, even though some are clearly a bit OP. Technically, the combat works great and looks absolutely amazing. Hitting a long parry chain feels great.\n\n[h3]CHARACTER PROGRESSION[/h3]\nEach character has a single weapon slot. You find many different weapons with unique properties during gameplay, it's fun to level up the weapons and discover new synergies. But some weapons are clearly better than others - if you want to min/max, this limits the options - but that's just normal. The pictos / lumina system is neat, basically you find items which first have to be \"unlocked\" by winning 4 battles. Once you've done that, the item's bonus gets added to a list of passive abilities. Switching between different loadouts works fine, even though it would have been cool to save some loadouts. The most powerful pictos are linked to exploration which is a nice touch.\n\n[h3]GRAPHICS & VISUAL DESIGN[/h3]\nUnreal Engine 5. Amazing art style, many distinct and fascinating areas. Facial animations are a bit stiff, but the characters look very detailed and natural. I disliked the overly washed out / bloomy look of the overworld, but with some tinkering, I managed to get rid of most of the terrible volumetric stuff. \n\n[h3]SOUND & MUSIC[/h3]\n11 / 10. The sound design is impeccable. During combat, using audio cues is often easier than just looking at the screen. And the music... holy shit. So many amazing pieces. The Sirène level was the highlight for me. Absolutely stunning work. \n\n[h3]NITPICKY STUFF[/h3]\n- Navigating the overworld in Act 1 is a bit janky. \n- Not having a quest log is fine, but it would be cool if the world map had some QOL features like checkmarks and a \"set marker\" option that would allow you to find stuff faster in the overworld. \n- The level design is good, but you can see how limited their budget was. it's mostly corridors with some side paths. But there's some Souls DNA in the level design which is cool. I enjoyed some of the environmental puzzles as well. \n- This is actually a game I'd love to collect all collectables - but not having any markers is a bit tiring. I get the idea behind it, but for completionists, it's a bit of a pain in the ass. Maybe they could add markers to NG+.\n\n[h3]SUMMARY[/h3]\nAn exceptional game on many levels. A game with so much personality, so much artistic vision. And... it's almost aggressively French, but in a cheeky kind of way.

The voice acting is superb with multiple scenes of characters talking over one another and making arguments and confessions and affirmations all sound natural and real. The soundtrack is astounding. I have not enjoyed a game OST as much as this one since Nier:Automata. \r\n\r\nThe graphics look good to me, but I have been told my opinion here sucks (1080p, 60FPS), so take it for what you will. I believe a recent patch improved ultra widescreen performance, but I can't speak to that. There were a few graphical glitches and some models seem to the move, slightly, during cutscenes or while exploring, but nothing that took me out of the moment or truly broke my immersion. Assassin's Creed:Unity, this is not. Even if they are both very French.\r\n\r\nAnd the gameplay is very, very satisfying. I was apprehensive about the combat, because the videos and screenshots I had seen made it seem very QTE of the early 00's. And it is that, but it is far more satisfying and well done. There is a lot more depth to building the characters between the weapons, stats, and abilities (pictos/luminas) than you might think at first. Though this is also where I have my biggest complaint: the menu UI is pretty weak. Not unusable, but not super easy to use either. There is no way to save \"loadouts,\" so I found myself lost when trying to go back to older builds. And later in the game, when you have lots of options, it is cumbersome and slow to go through all of the available skills and abilities. I won't pretend to know how to fix that, just that it felt like a weak part in an otherwise phenomenal game.\r\n\r\nBut the game rides the highest on it's story. At almost all steps, the game treats you as an adult and as someone who can think for themselves. Many parts of the world are not explained, because the people living in the world wouldn't need to explain them to each other. It is a refreshing way to craft the story and while it may frustrate some from time to time to not fully understand the mythos or history (myself included), it pays off multiple times. \r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, this is one of the most moving video games I have played in years. Like I said at the top, I was enthralled by the characters from the start and I struggled with decisions that must be made later. I am still reeling from the end of the story. The story twists and turns, but is always hinting at what is coming. If you know what you're looking for. I don't wish to say too much more, because the less one know's about the story, the more enjoyable it will be. Just know that I have nothing but praise for the writing and storytelling in this game.\r\n\r\nAll in all, this is a must play game. If you see it on sale, it is worth the price. If you don't see it on sale, it is worth the price. The soundtrack is worth the price. The game is worth it. Your time, money, and emotions are all worth the experience this game provides. Sandfall has done phenomenal work and I can only hope for more Clair Obscur in the future. The world begs for more details. Do yourself a favor, and play this game.

The main gimmick that sets it apart from other turn-based systems is that it includes dodge and parry mechanics. I did not think it was possible to make turn-based combat feel like a dance, but somehow they did it. The fights are so engaging, and it feels as though you are always in control, even when it isn't your turn. The build crafting is quite fun as well. All of the characters have their own unique abilities that synergize well with each other. Combining that with the wide variety of universal perks you can mix and match across the whole party, you can create some pretty interesting and fun combos. \n\n[b][u]Music[/u]: [/b] The soundtrack to Expedition 33 is amazing. From the dark emotional scenes to the epic boss fights, it sets the tone so well in every scenario the game puts you in. You will have music from this game stuck in your head for days after playing. It's just so good.\n\n[b][u]Graphics/Art[/u]: [/b] This is a beautiful game. The many different areas of the world all have such mesmerizing set pieces. The artistic stylization of the enemies, npcs, and effects are incredible too and fit the vibe that the game is trying to portray really well.\n\n[b][u]Story[/u]: [/b]  I want to avoid narrative spoilers as best as I can, so I will keep the following limited to my conceptual thoughts on the game. That said, I still think this game is best experienced blind, so I will spoiler tag it anyway.\n\n[spoiler]This is a game about the struggles of existence. Death, grief, and the ways we cope with loss. Finding your purpose, reaching fulfillment, and finishing what you've set out to do before your time is up. The harsh reality that the clock is ticking faster than many of us would like, and that many of us won't make it in time to accomplish our goals. But this game is also about hope. It's about pushing through the suffering towards a better future, if not for you, then for those who come after you. It's about lifting each other up and carrying each other through our struggles, even when we're dealing with struggles of our own. It's about being there for your fellow humans, even in the face of the worst that life can throw at you. \n\nThe characters in this game are so phenomenally written. Seeing the contrast of how they all deal with the above struggles is one of my favorite parts of this game. They all react so differently from one another, yet they all feel so human. The facial expressions in this game are incredible as well. There is so much character-level narrative told solely through physical expressions and body language, something I wish more games did well.\n\nThe way that the narrative drip feeds you information without throwing it all in your face is so well executed. It is very careful to give you just enough info to leave you with questions for a bit, but not so many questions that you're overwhelmed trying to mull it all over. This game is an emotional roller coaster. From the first 30 minutes to the last 30 minutes, your perspective will have changed drastically several times over. More importantly, this game will make you feel things (mostly sad things, this game single-handedly doubled the number of times I have cried in my entire adult life). \n\nAll of that to say, Expedition 33 is one of, if not [i]the best[/i] narratives I have ever experienced in any form of media.[/spoiler]\n\nIn my opinion, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the pinnacle of what it means for a video game to be a work of art.\n\n[b][u]Rating[/u]: [/b] 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1749777599, "timestamp_updated": 1749777703, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

And while I’m all for taking notes from *Nier*, it sadly skipped one of the best parts: the **fanservice**. Let’s be real—some light fanservice never hurt anyone and could’ve added a little spice to an otherwise very emotionally heavy experience. Instead, it leans *a little too hard* into the melancholic art-house vibes.\n\n**Story & Replay Value:**\n\nThe story is one of the game’s strongest suits. On the **first playthrough**, it’s already compelling, but the second run? That’s where it *really* hits. The narrative takes on a new layer once you know what’s coming. I **highly recommend** doing a second playthrough to see the pieces come together and unlock that **true ending** (if you didn't get it the first time), which was nothing short of **epic**. \n\n**Characters:**\n\nI didn’t expect to get this attached to the crew, but the **character development is top-tier**. Each member of Expedition 33 felt like a real person by the end—flawed, human, and worth caring about. By the time credits rolled, I wasn’t just invested in the plot—I genuinely enjoyed the company of the party.\n\n**Music:**\n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful, but man, it’s **depressing as hell**. There’s emotional depth in the compositions, no doubt, but I wish there were a few more tracks that offered some levity or hope. It kind of feels like being gently slapped by sorrow for 30 hours.\n \n**Gameplay:**\n\nNow, full disclosure—I’m not a turn-based combat guy. But Expedition 33 surprised me. The **reactive mechanics** (dodging/parrying during enemy turns) kept things engaging. It never felt like I was just sitting around waiting. Even as someone who usually avoids turn-based games, I had a good time.\n\n**Graphics:**\n\n**Absolutely stunning.** The game is a visual **feast**. From the gothic cityscapes to the eerie dreamlike dungeons, every environment was crafted with insane detail. It’s one of those rare games where I’d stop just to take in the view.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nSo yeah, not a perfect game—but one that **left a strong impression**. I respect what it tried to do and what it *mostly* pulled off. If you’re into emotional stories, beautiful worlds, and aren’t totally allergic to turn-based combat, give this one a go—and **definitely** play it twice.\n", "timestamp_created": 1749764425, "timestamp_updated": 1749764808, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Believe me when I say this is worth your time. \n\n I genuinely would say this is one of the crowning achievements of entertainment history in our generation. It is crafted by a core team of a few people that truly love what they do and have a passion for games and putting the player first. And it shows. It takes all the best elements of what makes a good RPG/JRPG - and makes something truly unique. It's the sort of RPG a lot of us have been waiting for years now. \n\nIt's one of those games that sticks with you -  having a well written story that makes you ponder for a while. Truly. And on top of that it's sprinkled with  absolute cinema with some of the best voice acting in video games - how naturally it flows within every conversation, the art direction of everything and how it weaves into the theme of the story and its world building as well.\n\nAlso, the graphics, and how gorgeous literally everything looks.  Every area is special in its own way - you feel like screenshotting everything, really. The gameplay which is more than just turn based, where you actively must dodge or parry, making it more immersive - and how absolutely smooth and slick it looks. \n\nThen there's the characters - all of them extremely well written in the way the see the world and their individual reasons for navigating it their way - and their little interactions with one another too.- I could go on and on. And let's not forget the absolute earcandy which is the OST! There is actually very little like to not like here for me, personally. \n\nOn an emotional level - the game also holds up an incredible weight. It makes you think about your choices, about grief, about life. I could personally relate to a lot of it - having experience loss, being the same age as many characters in the game, decisions that I had to make. All of it resonated with me - and it perhaps resonated with many too. Needless to say I wasn't the only one a sobbing through many parts of the game. Going from Act 1, until the end is quite the journey. It was an experience, for sure. \n\nI genuinely believe Expedition 33 gets everything that we expect from a video game absolutely on the nail. It's a miracle how they put all the best elements that was necessary with the people they stumbled upon, and it was most of their first major gigs, too. Props to everyone on the team, really. \n\nWithout question, easily in one of my top 10 games of all time. Tomorrow comes. \n", "timestamp_created": 1749759334, "timestamp_updated": 1749759334, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

I did not expect this game to impact me the way it has.\n\nThe story is a masterpiece. The writing is among some of the deepest in any game that's come out in the last decade or more. The game pulls you in and has you completely invested emotionally after the first 10 minutes, and it feels like it never stops. Every character has depth, their own motivations and values, and you can really feel how each character kind of...drives their own story within the larger game story. It's an epic, epic tragedy of a story. I can't say enough about how incredible the plot of this game is. For that alone, the game is already A-tier.\n\nThe combat system is an incredible mixture of turn-based combat with action elements. Don't get me wrong, it IS a turn-based RPG. But...we've spent so long being told by the gaming industry that turn-based combat would never work in the modern gaming landscape, and this game completely proves that sentiment wrong in every way. The combat system itself is polished, well thought out, and offers every type of player a chance to enjoy the combat. Even if you are not a turn-based combat fan, I truly believe this game's combat will still leave you satisfied. It's challenging, every fight is different, but it is SO rewarding when you master the combat in this game. \n\nWhen you add the flawless combat system to the masterpiece of a story...this game has easily become my second favorite turn-based RPG of all time. Sandfall has created something absolutely incredible here, and I highly encourage every player of every RPG genre to give it a chance. \n\nThere are a few things as of the current patch that I take minor issue with, and I believe that both of these things can be resolved by the developer through future patches, but I would be dishonest to not include them in my review.\n\nFor one, the late-game balancing needs some serious work. As I said above, the combat SYSTEM itself is perfect. The way you actually play combat is flawless. But in the late-game, your character growth can get so exponentially high so fast that by the end of the game, you can be one-shotting most things without needing to do a ton of grinding or treading off the beaten path. For sure, every turn-based RPG offers the ability to become literal gods to the players who take the time to grind it out. But this game as of right now basically gives that ability to even players who barely grind at all. It is too easy to become all-powerful stat-wise.\n\nThe other issue is more of a quality of life issue. Swapping builds on your characters is incredibly tedious at times. This game offers an INSANE amount of build customization for each character, which is fantastic. But swapping between builds that you're trying can be annoying simply because there is no system for swapping. I found it odd that a modern RPG like this with that level of build customization didn't include a simple build-swap mechanic. It's a QoL change that most modern RPGs like this have had for years. \n\nEven with those two things in mind though...this game is still up there with some of the greatest RPGs ever made. It is a must try for any fan of the genre, turn-based or not.", "timestamp_created": 1749753337, "timestamp_updated": 1749753337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

The system introduces a rhythm where well-timed reactions are rewarded (maybe a bit too much in fact,) and the early challenge pushes you to star on your toes and be engaged in combat. But after you've been parrying for hours on end, the novelty wears of and the fights start dragging on. The margin of error for some parries are razor thin (which is a good thing) but the consequences for a single misstep is too extreme. A regular enemy can wipe your entire party with a single AoE attack, and their attacks normally last for like 3-5 hits, if you miss one? you die.\n\nTake the Obscur enemy, for instance. His normal attacks condition you to parry after his first sword lights up, pretty learnable and transferable to all his other moves. But his gradient attack throws that out of the water, both swords light up, and if you react to the attack the same way you have done prior, you will be locked into the parry animation when the actual attack goes off, and you flop over and your Lune is on the floor yet again... You got caught in a trap disguised as consistency.\n\nThis kind of design repeats throughout the game. AoE attacks are overwhelming in frequency and damage, I'm fine with being punished for miss-timing a hit, but I don't think it's fair that the punishment is a party wipe. And this is only really true for common enemeies. Bosses, in fact feel more balanced. I could normally face tank a couple of hits from them and still have a fair bit of health left. You get plenty of room to breathe, they aren't too punishing. But I dunno, I'd say if big named bosses are a lesser threat than trash mobs, something's off :V\n\nI think there is a total of 4 different types of attack, each having a different cue:\nRhythm-based,\nA little sound cue pinging right before the proper parry time,\nPurely animation-based,\n(not too sure about this one, I feel like it is one but haven't ironed the proper timing out) Camera-based.\n\nSome of these animation-based attacks generally from bosses and more threatening enemies, have soo much visual noise, that it's hard to see what's happening, let alone parse the attack.\nAs the rhythm-based and sound cue. The game's music, the audio effect from a previous parry, or the boss yapping can deafen the cue/rhythm, leaving you guessing.\n\nThen there's the camera, its quite a stinker as the youngsters call it, it tries to be real cutesy and positions itself in a cinematic view for all the visual effects. But this just sometimes has the small problem of visually obscuring said attack lol.\nDuring one of Tissure's attacks, it flew behind a fucking rock, totally obstructing the view like :>\nIt also likes low angles, so gauging the depth of some attacks can be pretty hard...\n\nGame doesn't penalise you from dying. But since you are going to get slapped around soo much you are gonna get frustrated, not because you died, but because there isn't a restart button, you are forced to waltz back to start the encounter again, having to skip the cutscene again, and viewing the 30 second animation in the middle of the fight again...\n(You can \"Quicksave\" by either using a Chroma Elixir or changing a part of a person's loadout, this will drastically reduce the amount of waltzing back.)\n\nDamage variance is quite bizarre. One critical hit might deal 1000 damage bigpog, then the exact same attack next turn hits for 8000? I dunno. Meanwhile, attacks labelled as \"High physical damage 5 hits\" (These are especially delicious since it attacks multiple times, since the starting damage cap is 9999, these effectively allows you to do even more damage per turn.) But it lands for a whimpering 900-1500 damage per hit, meanwhile a chill counterattack reached the 9999 damage cap :>\n\nWeapon scaling is also messy. If an enemy is immune to your current weapons element, you're of course expected to switch to a different one.... But none of the other weapons for said character scales based on your builds stats... It just punishes you without offering flexibility, I'd excuse it if resetting the stats were free, but its not.\n\nALSO, I think its such a missed opportunity. The entire setting is you are part of an expedition, facing ruins of the old world, fighting threats others have faced before you and new threats.\nWouldn't it be perfect to find hand-drawn maps left by earlier expeditioners, or pieces of bestiaries passed down to help those who comes after. The world building of the game is BEGGING for it. Journaling, researching monster weakness, their strengths, collecting intel for those who comes after. It would fit perfectly into the theme and would serve as well a bestiary for what enemies drop, their weakness and strength. :V\nIt's a natural extension of the setting, and its absence feels downright weird.\n\nMusic is pretty neat though :>\n\nTLDR, combat sucks, play for the wonders of the world.", "timestamp_created": 1749749697, "timestamp_updated": 1749749697, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47970736026763916", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Fun combos and a decent size world to explore for a turn-based game that is NOT open world. It is linear, but theres lots of little secrets and bonus stuff to do. I spent 38 hours on main story first time around, but I explored a ton and sstill couldn't beat everything I came across. For sure will have more to do in NewGame+ as far as harder areas as well. Can replay, but If you paid attention the first time, you wont get much more out of the story on a second run tbh.", "timestamp_created": 1749746277, "timestamp_updated": 1749747344, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Just buy the game. Full price if you have to.\r\n\r\nIt's a turn-based Japanese-style RPG, but with precise parrying mechanics. It has distinct Elden Ring / Dark Souls influences in the way secret areas are structured, and in the general nature of the bosses. It's also unapologetically French in many ways. The Romantic influences, the language, the dress, the setting. Some have called it \"Frapanese\". Frankly it's a fusion I didn't realize we needed this badly.\r\n\r\nThe story is great, which is saying a lot because I don't get sucked into stories easily. The emotional moments are earned, not forceful and heavy handed (though at times I think they lean on the score TOO much to sell those moments). The world is intriguing and I genuinely wanted to learn more about it. They don't dump exposition on you. Instead, you slowly learn the reality of this world through exploration.\r\n\r\nThe music is unlike anything I've heard. It will pivot from operatic melodramatic soaring vocals, straight into orchestral techno, then into brass-heavy jazz. It's really eclectic and lovely to behold. The overworld music gets a bit irritating after a while for me personally. But overall the OST is amazing. Every boss battle, I was equally excited to hear the new boss music. It's that good.\r\n\r\nThe sound design is exceptional. Audio cues especially help you learn the parry timing, which by the way is not necessary if you aren't interested in the fast-twitch style gameplay. I thought I wouldn't care or wouldn't be good enough at it, but frankly it's fun and extremely satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe battle animations are awesome. They do feel very Japanese in their flourish, which is praise in my book. But they still feel hard-hitting and impactful.\r\n\r\nThe skill tree system is very simple, but battle modifiers (called Pictos) can be mixed and matched in near infinite combinations, making theory crafting very fun. With the right setup, you can make yourself and absolute monster.\r\n\r\nThere's a very straight direct line to the main story of the game, and I'd imagine that could be completed in roughly 20 hours. I did as much of the side content as I could, and I \"beat\" the game proper around 45 hours. But there is a mountain of post-game content as well, and frankly that is where the game really shines in my opinion. There are lots of side areas that are too difficult to beat until you unlock something specific after the first major \"ending\" of the game. I expect to get at least 65-70 hours out of this game before I'm done. And that's not even counting NG+.\r\n\r\nThe environments are gorgeous and unique. It's not your typical \"ice, grass, mountain, lava, desert\" biome. There's a bit of that, which keeps it familiar and grounded. But mostly it's otherworldly, ancient, bizarre, intriguing, and just a joy to explore. The characters are lovely and the small number of cosmetic items they have really gives a good opportunity for making the team your own.\r\n\r\nI can't recommend it enough. I really think this is a strong GotY contender.", "timestamp_created": 1749744950, "timestamp_updated": 1749744950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

The parry is so satisfying, that I always look forward to my enemy's turn. And even if you’re not usually into this genre, Expedition 33 makes it incredibly welcoming — especially after the recent patch that makes Story Mode more forgiving.\n\nThe characters are just as memorable as the world around them, and the themes of the story hit hard without feeling heavy-handed.

This game has it all honestly, between great exploration and intense emotional character development. There are moments of intense action, sweet lulls of tender moments, and absolutely agonizing heartbreak. The combat in this game is challenging, rewarding precision, strategy, and timing. It is a turn-based system, but requires precision on parrying, evading, or jumping, enemy attacks; failure to do so can result in significant damage.\r\n\r\nIf there were any nitpicks, I would say that the game has invisible walls on narrow paths. Sometimes you try a path and find out there's a secret hidden area; sometimes your character just jumps in place on an invisible wall. This is more prevalent than you might think and does irk me at times. Also, there are some platforming sections of the game, which are fine except that you don't have free range with the camera and have to operate on an off-kilter character model. You get used to it, but it makes the precision platforming sections a little awkward.\r\n\r\nAnyway, highly highly recommend checking this game out.

But in the end the \"wheee\" balanced out the \"whooo\". So\nDespite some major balancing issues in late game I still recommend this game whole heartedly and I believe everyone should experience this art.\n\nI absolutely adore the story, well written characters and the picturesque setting of Lumiere and the continent. The mystery of the painteress and the intrigue of finding out just what has happened to this world mixed with amazing music, is so captivating that I found myself having a hard time putting the controller down for the day and come back the next day after work. \n\nThe dialogue between characters is at times fun, at times sad and most times thought provoking and it's performed beautifully. This game heavily focuses on and tackles difficult subjects like grief, a topic I have personally struggled (and still struggle) with. That's why when I finally finished the game after 70 hours, the story hit a very deep spot for me.\n\nThe combat is fun and it's a breathe of fresh air into the Turn-Base JRPG genre. I'm sure others have already praised the combat enough in other reviews. \n\nWhat I want to point out about the combat and character systems are two things, first, the complex and deeper systems for leveling up a characters stats are never explained properly. I personally started figuring out how Luminas and Pictos work and how to equip a different weapon and upgrade it (since each level range on a weapon needs a different type of item to be able to upgrade it to the next level range) in early/mid act 2, which is way too late. Before this, as you can imagine, the combat was tedious and frustrating as my characters were all underpowered. \n\nThat brings me to the second point, balancing. This is an important topic that can ruin your experience in the game, especially when you play it for the first time. After getting squad wiped by multiple bosses during act 2 while playing on medium difficuly, I decided to look up some community builds and try to figure out what am I doing wrong? It would've been a shame if I would've given up out of frustration (since some boss fights took upwards of 3 hours with multiple squad wipes), then I wouldn't have experienced the amazing story. \n\nSince I didn't want to go to act 3 and get further frustrated because of the unfairness of the combat system, I ended up doing side quests, finding different Pictos, putting characters that go well together in one team etc. Turns out that now I have tipped the balance (or lack thereof) completely to the other side. I dog walked the last act because my characters were now way over powered. \n\nI could only enjoy the final fights and see all the epic move sets of the bosses thanks to the update which came out 1 day before I finish the game and that allowed me to put multipliers on enemy health to make the fights last longer instead of the bosses getting one shot. That's the only complaint that I have about the game.", "timestamp_created": 1749739259, "timestamp_updated": 1749739259, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Not only does it feature incredible combat mechanics that break away from the often tedious and formulaic nature of traditional JRPGs, but it also stuns with its breathtaking visuals and music. Clair Obscur stands as a bold statement to the entire gaming industry — a direct response to massive studios who hide behind excuses for underwhelming results, bloated budgets, poor optimization, or unjustifiable pricing.\n\nWhat sets this game apart is the undeniable passion behind it. Created by a team that clearly loves games and storytelling, Clair Obscur wasn’t made to chase quarterly revenue or pander to market trends. It was made out of genuine love for the craft, and for the player. And that love has borne fruit — as people around the world enjoy it with massive smiles on their faces and tears rolling down their cheeks.\n\n[h2] Combat Mechanics [/h2]\nAs someone who doesn’t usually enjoy turn-based RPGs, I wasn’t bored for a second. The combat is fast, reactive, and layered with depth. Whether you want to build Maëlle into a Stendhal one-shot machine or burn the world down with Lüne’s massive AoE spells — you can. The Pictos system is brilliantly designed. You’re never locked into one playstyle; you can tailor the difficulty and combat strategy however you like.\n\n[h2] World Design and Music [/h2]\nAbsolutely stunning. The story is unique, but it’s the colors and atmosphere of the world that elevate everything. Each area feels like a dreamscape, surreal and meaningful. The dynamic soundtrack brings every encounter, character, and place to life. Shifting from gloomy classical to jazzy chaos in seconds, the emotional rollercoaster is unlike anything I’ve seen.\n\n[h2] Characters & Writing [/h2]\nThe characters feel truly alive. They don’t follow a traditional story arc or fit neatly into tropes. Each one is filled with questions, doubts, and personal philosophies. Everyone has their own perception of what’s happening, their own interpretation of right and wrong. In the end, it all narrows down to you to analyze the world, make unavoidable sacrifices, and decide what you believe is right… even if it means turning your back on those who believe you’re wrong.\n\n[h2] There Are No Complaints [/h2]\nSeriously, none. People often complain about combat being repetitive or stories being overly cringe, but there’s none of that here. The pacing is tight, the writing is sincere, and the game respects your time and allows you go through as fast or slow as you want.\n\n[h2] C’est très français [/h2]\nAs someone who’s played hundreds of games, you start to recognize design signatures. Like how DMC, Resident Evil, and Dark Souls have design and story arc elements that are commonly found across most of the Japanese games, Clair Obscur doesn’t feel like any of that. This game feels [b]very French[/b] — and I mean that in the best way possible. It adds so much to the experience, immersing you in the culture, the mindset, and the poetic madness of its characters.\nI don’t think I’ll ever make fun of the French again... not after how this game beat my sanity down with a [i]baguette[/i].\n\n[h2] Final Thoughts [/h2]\nI can only imagine that this game must be a push forward for everyone in the game-dev space to just go for it if you love it. A proof that you don’t need multi-million-dollar companies behind you to make something great. I’m really glad that this project is so successful. Honestly, it kind of makes me want to start developing games… but that’s besides the point.\n\nIf you love good storytelling, you’ll love this game. I can’t wait to see what Sandfall will show us next, but until then, I’m sure Clair Obscur will stand as an example for all others trying to get their games across to the world.\n\n[i]For those who come after.[/i]", "timestamp_created": 1749903886, "timestamp_updated": 1749903886, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

With its melancholic beauty, gripping world, and emotional resonance, it is no surprise one of the best games ever created.\nFrom the very first moments, the game wastes no time with exposition dumps or hand-holding. Instead, it thrusts you directly into its surreal, decaying version of Paris, where death is an annual lottery and hope is a fragile ember. This choice in pacing reflects the confidence of its creators: every scene, every line of dialogue, every character interaction is deliberate. There’s no filler just a lean, emotionally charged journey that grips you from beginning to end.\nThe heart of Expedition 33 lies in its story. It tackles powerful themes like loss, mortality, and legacy without ever feeling preachy. The narrative is rich with symbolism and mystery, and it encourages players to uncover the truth piece by piece, often through the remnants of fallen predecessors. The game trusts you to think, to wonder, and to feel — a rare quality in today’s landscape.\nThe world itself is stunningly original. Drawing from Belle Époque-era French culture with a heavy surrealist twist, the environments are haunting, dreamlike, and drenched in atmosphere. Whether you're wandering crumbling mansions, exploring twisted caverns, or standing in the quiet beauty of moonlit fields, every locale feels hand-crafted and alive with narrative significance.\nVisually, Claire Obscur is a masterpiece. Its  art style using light and shadow to dramatic effect isn't just beautiful; it reinforces the emotional tone of each scene. The character design, especially the eerie, puppet-like expressions of some NPCs, adds to the unsettling atmosphere, making even still moments feel charged with tension.\nComplementing the visuals is one of the best soundtracks in recent memory. Composed by Lorien Testard, the music doesn't just accompany the story  it elevates it. Tracks range from delicate piano motifs to sweeping orchestral themes, and each piece is perfectly timed to the emotion of the moment. The soundtrack has even topped classical music charts, which speaks volumes about its impact.\nVoice acting is another standout element. With a cast that includes Charlie Cox and Andy Serkis, the performances are deeply nuanced and emotionally authentic. These are not just characters — they’re people, brought to life through exceptional vocal work.\nMechanically, Expedition 33 walks the line between traditional turn-based systems and modern action-RPG dynamics. Combat is turn-based in structure, but heavily interactive in execution. Players must actively dodge, parry, or respond to quick-time prompts during enemy attacks, making each encounter feel intense and participatory. It's a system that rewards skill as much as strategy.\nThere’s also real depth to party composition, elemental affinities, and skill progression. Synergizing your team whether to exploit weaknesses or chain together combo attacks  is immensely satisfying. The pacing of battles is brisk, often cinematic, and never tedious, ensuring that gameplay feels as alive as the narrative.\nThe cast of characters is memorable and diverse. Each Expedition member is distinct, with personal motivations, traumas, and dreams. Even side characters such as the chaotic Gestrals like Noco are brimming with personality and contribute meaningfully to the story's themes.\nDialogue is sharp, witty, and often emotionally devastating. Relationships evolve organically, and key story moments carry genuine weight. Few games manage to create such a strong emotional bond between the player and their companions.\nFrom a technical standpoint, the game is remarkably polished. \nMenus, UI, and systems design are all clean and intuitive. Despite the game’s depth, it never overwhelms.

It's beautiful, heartfelt, and I found it deeply affecting. I won't get spoilery in this review, but the way the game approaches the very nature of storytelling, and the many roles that art as a whole plays in our lives, was deeply interesting. This game got hella layers. \nI don't often go on reddit and the steam forums to read people's interpretations of game narratives, sadly not many games warrant that type of further investigation, but the way Expedition 33 was written and the larger lore surrounding it, made it a fascinating experience to go on a bit of a deep dive.\n\nThe music, the writing, the worldbuilding, the performances, the art direction, holy shit all of it is really good stuff. A brand new, [b]wildly[/b] original IP to boot. I tend to complain about all the remakes, remasters, rehashes and reboots quite a lot, but I dont think even I realised how starved I was for something new and fresh until this came along. I do not buy games on or around release date, because the industry has well and truly fucked me a few too many times, but this is one of those rare instances where I'm really happy I did.\n\nCombat is pretty unique, and it took me almost 10 hours to really click with it. On the top layer you have all the tactical turnbased stuff which can get deliciously strategic, but it is [i]constantly[/i] underpinned with realtime mechanics. The parry windows in particular are punishing, and missing a parry can have pretty severe consequences based on how you built your characters.\nEnemy animations are purposefully designed to trip you up, but once you realize how crucially important the sound cues are it becomes more manageable. Your eyes will deceive you, but your ears wont. Mostly. The realtime mechanics often play out like a rhythm game almost. There is a definite and measured flow to it, and even as a person who generally hates souls-likes I found this combat system engrossing. And very, very satisfying when I pull off a huge counter.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3478038438\nOptions and synergies are plentiful, and respeccing your builds isn't too costly so I had a lot of fun trying all kinds of different strategies. Character building was really fun, in part because everyone has their own unique mechanic.\nMy one gripe with the game's systems was the inability to downgrade weapons. The perks on them are often major and can massively impact your character builds, however upgrading them is costly and once you've committed a lot of resources into a particular weapon it becomes suboptimal to start using a different one, even if it has better or just different perks. \n\nWhat really stuck out to me the most about it all was how much I came to care about these characters. The writing and voice work are really top tier. Sandfall is a relatively small studio, but they've delivered a level of quality that puts massive AAAs to shame that are literally 10 times their size. Honestly, there are not a lot of games that manage to engage me emotionally as much as Expedition 33 did. \nI really loved how the dialogue just flows. Characters can interrupt eachother, or talk over eachother. RPGs really seem to struggle with stilted voice direction so I was pleasantly surprised with how polished that aspect of the game is. Combined with the outstanding facial animations and that intensely beautiful soundtrack Clair Obscure grabbed me tightly by the balls and didn't let go for a second.\n\nMy fave character turned out to be Verso, bless his duplicitous little heart. You learn about him by observing him. You learn who he is by looking at his actions throughout the game and putting it together yourself. \nActually this holds true for most of the characters, and even the world surrounding them. There's no exposition dumps. There's no narrator at the beginning, telling you the 100 year history of this world. Characters can straight up lie, and not in that bullshit 'press x to doubt' way - I mean [i]really[/i] lie, to others or to themselves. They can change their minds, or their motivations, and this is so rare to see in a video game.\nWhenever you do learn something new, it's always strongly reflected through the lens of one of the characters. The character work in this game is really something else.\nLearning about Esquie and Monoco's origins turned me into a puddle. Maelle is a two for one, very good deal. Lune? I love her. A woman of commitment and sheer fucking will. Fuck! They're all complicated, flawed, interesting characters and don't even get me started on the antagonists we'll be here until next week. \n\nThe level of originality oozing from every square inch of this game really is commendable. The worldbuilding on display here is often breathtaking, and there is sooo much fine detail in it all if you slow down to take it in - as I frequently had to in order to appreciate the scenery.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3471344383\nTalking of the bigger picture, one of the main reasons I enjoyed it so much is that the game isn't afraid to stew and simmer. It stretches out and revels in dramatic tension and doesn't feel the need to immediately pop that balloon. \nMaybe I'm just over-sensitive to this sort of thing because I just finished Dragon Age The Veilguard before jumping into Clair Obscure, and Bioware constantly, and I really mean constantly, seemed downright afraid to let narrative pressure build up. There was always some character quipping 'Oh, that looks really bad! omg!\" and not once did they just let that tension build. Even during dramatic scenes, they had to jump in with some comic relief and break both any remaining immersion that may have been there, and worse, any sense of sincerity or vulnerability in the scene.\n\nThat's not to say that Expedition 33 doesn't have moments of levity, but they always fit and feel appropriate, as opposed to the bullshit that Bioware was shoveling. I don't think there was a single joke in the game that didn't land. Overall though the game takes itself very seriously, and is committed to itself in a way that makes the audience commit to it as well. At least I sure felt that way.\n\nWhen a character faces almost certain death and starts making snide remarks about how expensive the drycleaning bill is gonna be afterwards, I mean thats fine sometimes, I get it, it can be fun. That style of writing has just become so tiringly overused. Expedition 33 has a moment right in the beginning with Gustav after landing on the continent where I think most other games would have done something similar. Gustav went in a different direction, which immediately set a certain tone for the game. As that scene played out, with The Veilguard still fresh in the back of my mind, I smiled to myself and hoped that the rest of the game will be just as good. And as I got deeper into it, it just kept getting better.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3477314766\nIt took me right around 50 hours to get close to 100% completion; I'm pretty sure the only things I haven't finished were some collectibles. A lot of games seem to think that the more time they take to get through, the better. Expedition 33 is such a perfect example of why that's usually wrong.\nI didn't get so deeply invested into this game because I spent 150+ hours playing it. I didn't fall in love with these characters because I collected 50 boar pelts across each region of the map or whatever the fuck. \n\nI didn't need to clear out a gazillion samey dungeons or tread through a hundred filler questlines to feel like I've experienced an epic journey. I have experienced an epic journey, because that is just how the game was written. \n\nI'm so excited to see what Sandfall comes out with next.

I went in mostly blind, not expecting a lot, and was completely blown away. The game does a lot of things really well, and definitely deserves the praise its getting. \r\n\r\nNow, getting on to the actual review, this thing looks incredible. Like the environments looks absolutely phenomenal, while not requiring you to have a NASA level PC. I had a mid range rig and was able to play it at mostly 60 fps (except for cutscenes for some reason?) at medium-high graphic settings (still looks amazing at medium). The UI also looks quite neat, but man is it a fucking pain in the ass to navigate on a controller. Also the soundtrack, its just so fucking peak. A lot of the tracks reminded me of Nier OST. (Fun fact, they found the guy who did the OST on soundcloud, and he only had like one post or something there)\r\nThe plot is also fucking amazing. It doesn't even fall off later or anything, stays amazing throughout the game. The characters were also really interesting and had pretty good dialogue.\r\n\r\nCombat is quite interesting and really good. This is coming from a person who didn't like the dodge/parry mechanic as much. All of the characters have their own unique mechanic, and you can mould their stats into anything. There's no class system where its already decided that this character will be a defensive one, this will an offensive one, etc. This does sound like it would give a lot of freedom, but I felt that choice was mostly just an illusion. Most characters just don't have any defensive skills. Plus, the enemies start doing a toon of damage later on, so you're just gonna be running offensive builds on everything while parrying to avoid dying. Not saying defensive builds aren't possible, but they just didn't seem that viable, at least on Hard mode. \r\n\r\nThis game has a system where you can equip passives on characters, which is one of the major ways to gain power. There's a ton of them.t. Gives you a decent bit of choice on how you are gonna be building your characters (for dps). Speaking of variety, weapons also got it. They added an absolute metric ton of weapons for each character, and they're not just lame stat-sticks. 99% of them have passives which can completely change the way a character is gonna be playing. Though it was a bit annoying how you couldn't make loadouts for different characters. If you wanted to change to a different build, you'd have to sit through the 20 billion things you have a pick the ones you need every single time.\r\n\r\nPacing wise, for the main plot, it felt pretty nice. At no point did I feel it was getting rushed or getting too slow. Progression wise, its pretty good for the first half of the game, but ends up being shit for the second half. Just before the final quest of the game, you unlock like the remaining half of the world left to explore, and most areas just end up being too high levelled. So you just have to figure out yourself where to go next, grind there and then figure out again where to go after that. There's also this character relationship system they added, which was kinda nice, but felt a bit half baked. You get relationship levels very slowly during the majority of the main plot, and then just before the final quest, you unlock the final 4-5 levels to go through. Kinda wished they had unlocked this system a bit early in the game, so you could get through those levels at a consistent rate. Exploration was also great, there was always something cool to find at every spot, and there's a toooon of cool side content to do (except for those swimsuit minigames, fuck them).\r\n\r\nThe early-mid game was quite challenging on Hard mode. The enemies were tough, had hard hitting moves, and you really had to learn their attack patterns. But the endgame ended up being quite easy. (I'm not even talking about one particular move that everyone says is broken). I know you can just not equip some of the endgame passive abilities, but I just don't like nerfing stuff on your own in order to get a challenge. Though, the endgame bosses were quite insane. I did try them with scuffed builds and did get my ass whooped a ton of times, because of how hard some of them are to parry/dodge. \r\n\r\nYeah, ig that's about it, overall a 9/10.

And the visual storytelling is better than anything Hollywood or Indies have put out in a long time.\r\n\r\nThe game play is well balanced and even designed to let you get overpowered only to throw a boss at you that will but you back into your place(even in story mode). It is turn based, which I usually see as a drawback, but I feel it serves to better tell the story as I feel the combat adds more tension and impact to each battle in general and especially for those that are part of the main storyline. And it has a story mode for those that are bad at using the game's mechanics or can't use the mechanics because of a disability.\r\n\r\nThe art style is unique in a way that that helps the narrative and make each area feel alive and representative of the creatures there. \r\n\r\nI wept uncontrollably at the end which is even more than I've done at any funeral(yet).\r\n\r\nThis games sits above the likes of Mass Effect 2(my previous #1 GOAT), Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Jak & Daxter Trilogy, God of War(2018), Cyberpunk 2077, Journey, Kingdom Hearts, Hades & Halo: Reach as the best game I've ever played.\r\n\r\nWhen you play this game, let yourself get immersed and think about what it would be like to live there and have to live as one of the characters. You won't regret it. \r\n\r\nThis game has already spawned psychological and philosophical debates.

Since i took my time exploring the map i overleveled and killed the final story boss in 2 hits, but then the endgame content gets way harder and there is also a lot to do and explore.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is truly a masterpiece and one of the best aspects of the game. It ranges from classical piano and violin music to jazz and even funk, the variation in music is incredible and the songs are bangers.\r\n\r\nThis game shows that when you have dedicated developers that are truly passionate in what they are doing they can accomplish wonders and fantastic piece of art, just like Elden Ring, Baldur's Gate 3, The Witcher 3 and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.

If there’s any game that deserves a perfect score, it’s this one.\n\nStory – 10/10\nThe best story I’ve ever witnessed in a video game. From minute one, the intro grabs you with a hook so strong, you’re locked in. You think you know where it’s going? You don’t. It keeps surprising you at every turn, and every moment feels meaningful.\n\nCharacters – 10/10\nEvery character feels alive, real, and unforgettable. You care deeply about them, and their development throughout the journey is nothing short of masterful.\n\nWorld/Atmosphere – 10/10\nThe worldbuilding and ambiance are flawless. Every area feels handcrafted with love, packed with detail and emotional weight.\n\nCombat – 10/10\nTurn-based combat doesn’t get better than this. It’s strategic, rewarding, stylish, and perfectly balanced. Probably the best of its kind.\n\nMusic – 10/10 (or more)\nIf I could rate the music higher than 10, I would. It’s an absolute masterpiece on its own—moving, epic, and unforgettable. I’ve found myself listening to the soundtrack outside the game just to relive the emotions.\n\nThis is one of those once-in-a-generation titles.

I can live with that.\r\n\r\nThe game is very cerebral if you want it to be. It was great to guess what was actually happening until the big reveal in Act 2. The villains are three-dimensional and have valid motives. One of the main characters has extreme flaws.  Everyone has their own form of trauma.  There are multiple layers and metaphors in the plot which are sparking so many debates online about which is the \"good\" and the \"bad\" ending. Spoiler: It's neither.  Despite that, it didn't leave a bitter feeling when I finished. I cried nonstop throughout the game and felt catharsis with the heavy topics, but I laughed so hard at the lighter humor.  The writers were fantastic at finding the balance.\r\n\r\nIt's not a turn-based game in the slightest, and yet it is.  You can make it easier if you want that kind of thing, or you can make it harder if you like to punish yourself with Souls' like games. As a blend of Final Fantasy, Nier, Souls/Bloodborne, and SO many other classic hits, this game is going to be hands down the GoTY.  \r\n\r\nFinal Fantasy X has been my favorite game since it came out, but after 20+ years, it finally met its match.

I remember seeing a trailer once a while ago but the first steam trailer I'm hearing the narration of Jennifer English and the overall premise of the game, I figure why not. I am going to school to learn game development and art for a little context as to why this game interested me so much because of the overall visuals, voice castings, the subtle facial animations, the music and style of game, I just said fuck it and went in blind.\n\nAnd I was so happy I did!\n\nEvery new combat was something unique in their design with interesting combat patterns relevant to the world you found them in. At first I began in expert mode because, how bad could it be :) I turned it off after losing to a practice enemy. BUT! After understanding the parry mechanics and how the game operated with windows of time to parry and dodge and returned to Expert mode, it made the combat all the more rewarding when counterattacking! I felt visually and mechanically rewarded so nicely when I learned the rhythms that it kept me hooked. I will say, I also felt so pissed off sometimes but that made it all the more satisfying to beat a boss.\n\nYou quickly discover the music that accompanies the game and the cut scenes and for the first time listening, you just kind of lose yourself to how hard some of those songs HIT. And they hit hard and fast.\n\nThe story is also so beautiful in the nuances of how we, as people, process grief. That is all I will say about that. Try not to spoil yourself and enjoy the journey. The characters are all unique in how they have processed in the world they live. Love them or not, they're undeniably interesting in how they contribute to the story.\n\nTo note: there are things that could be improved, don't get me wrong. However, a majority of that is just QOL features in which, since me posting this, they've already addressed a few problems and I hope they will continue to in the future, at least the major ones :)\n\nThis game is a beautiful masterpiece and testament to what a small group of insanely talented and dedicated artists can do when given the opportunity to really sit down explore their ideas. It helps set the bar for future games in what you can achieve with just a small budget and team in comparison to larger corporate companies. \n\nI recommended this game to most of my friends after reaching the end of Act 1 and from then to now, all we do is send is E33 memes and art :)\n\nExcited to see what else Sandfall will create in the future!", "timestamp_created": 1749848941, "timestamp_updated": 1749848995, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

The mechanics will be divisive for some (i.e., the hybrid reactive/action game elements present during some of combat, with the more traditional turn-based combat at play for skill selection and item use). For others, the aesthetics may be a turn-off (i.e., the look, ‘feel’ and sound). What could turn most people away lay in the narrative department, though. \n\n“Expedition 33” is one of the darkest fantasy stories I’ve ever engaged with and not simply for its superficial premise of stopping the Paintress from continuing her slow but inevitable eradication of civilization. Its overt exploration of grief, loss and family are handled deftly but unapologetically, thus are absolutely brutal in presentation and delivery. This is one of the few games I’ve played that has required me to at times put down the controller and walk away due to the intensity of the emotional impact in certain sections of the story (“The Last of Us” and “Mass Effect 3” did the same).\n\nIf you can accept all of that, what you get is a game which unflinchingly examines difficult topics with grace, respect and a level of depth and consideration unknown to most entertainment media, full stop. The story will make you laugh and cry, fill you with despair, inspire you with hope. The visuals are gorgeous and at times disturbing. The game play is phenomenal (and I’m glad the game came out now, since I’m wondering how much longer players will continue to be enamored with mechanics reliant on parry/rhythm). The soundtrack is magnificent and moving. And all of it, ALL OF IT, the story, the music, the characters, the visuals, is so layered that it will remain on your mind long after you’ve finished it. Days or possibly weeks later, you’ll make another connection or have another realization. It’s deep. Deep enough to border on profound. \n\nI could spend another thousand words trying to convey how wonderful, beautiful and important this game is only to come up short at the end. Instead, I will say this: “Clair Obscur: Expedition 33” is not only one of the best games I have ever played, it is one of the most powerful and poignant pieces of media I have ever interacted with. It is a shining example of games as art and playing through it was a privilege I will not soon forget.\n\n Merci, Sandfall, pour votre chef d’oeuvre. Je ne serai plus le meme.\n\n“Expedition 33” gets an emphatic ‘yes’ from me. So many paint-stained, tear-streaked thumbs up. 10/10. Recommended for: gamers who like music; turn-based devotees looking for some action to spice up the genre; action players wanting to dip their toes in turn-based waters; adventurous souls brave enough to feel (provided you have no existing trauma around the issues being plumbed).

The twist at the end reframes the entire story and central conflict in a way that gives it massive replayability, if only to see the entire story from the beginning with a new perspective.\r\n\r\nThe combat can be challenging at times, especially when encountering a new enemy or learning a new mechanic - but that makes mastering it all the more satisfying when you finally defeat that difficult boss.\r\n\r\nThis game is an absolute steal at $50 for its quality and length of content. 37 hours in, I'm still on my first playthrough, working through what feels like probably another twenty hours worth of end-game content before I plan to immediately go back and play through it again. This accomplishment by a tiny indie studio is a massive rebuke to the bloated AAA studios that ship unfinished, low-quality games and have the audacity to charge $70 for them. \r\n\r\nI don't think I've ever written a game review before, but felt compelled to do so for this one.

It fixes many problems I personally have with turned based games adding engaging real time components to make even the simple battles feel fun. Additionally its simplification of JRPG systems such as having only a few reusable consumables and a streamlined perk and skill system make building your party feel much less daunting compared to games in the same genre. Combined with a great character-driven story, exceptional voice acting, and an insanely good score, it’s easy to overlook the games few flaws such as some underwhelming side content and limited skill selection. Expedition 33 is a near masterpiece and the creativity of its environments and world makes this game worth playing alone.\n\nPOSITIVES\n-Some of the most visually stunning and creative environments I have ever laid eyes on in a video game\n-Amazing enemy variety and boss design\n-Great character-driven story with phenomenal voice acting\n-Fixes lots of complaints I usually have with turn-based games, with real-time battles, and simple reusable consumables\n-Streamlined progression system compared to other JRPGs that allows for decent build variety\n-Animation quality from cutscenes to attacks were fluid and very well done making very memorable experiences\n-The music genuinely had me tweaking at how good it was\n\nNEGATIVES\n-Some areas of the game were pretty disappointing to explore as their design was stunning but lacked any substantial content\n-Quality of life for sorting through perks and lack of a load out system\n-Limited skill selections with most characters only having around 20 skills, with many of them falling off in the late game", "timestamp_created": 1749844565, "timestamp_updated": 1749844589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}
