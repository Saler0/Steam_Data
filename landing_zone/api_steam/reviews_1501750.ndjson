Well, let me start with gameplay. All in all, a smooth experience. I never felt like the game was clumsy, dodges are substantial and I frames pretty forgiving like in actual modern From Software games, avoiding the usual issue where dodging attacks feels more like a chore then actual fun. Hitting an enemy just \"Feels\" good, the sound feedback and blood splatter makes the combat feel visceral and entertaining. Enemy move sets feel pretty fair, as do their healthbars (Besides a few annoying exceptions, but let's be real, which souls game doesn't have at least one of those?) And Bosses? Honestly, both in their design, fight OST, arenas and movesets, almost every single boss becomes a major highlight.\r\n\r\nExploration feels nice. The areas are well designed, linear in spirit, but enough nooks and crannies to find secrets and extra stuff in. This is doubled by using the \"Umbral Realm\" to access different areas. Again, there are a few areas where you roll your eyes on subsequent playthroughs, because they are REALLY annoying, but again, it kind of follows the Souls spirit in that regard.\r\n\r\nGraphically, the game looks stunning. Armors are really well designed, fashion souls is very strong in this game, you can create some insanely cool looking characters depending on your taste. Build variety follows suit, while obivously we can all argue about what's the \"Meta\", I tried out a bunch of different weapons, magic schools and styles, all of them working fairly well.\r\n\r\nNow, all of this is \"Up to taste\". Even among my friends, while they like the game, they wouldn't call it their favorite. Some of you might enjoy for example Lies of P more, some of you might gravitate towards Nioh. But to me, Lords of The Fallen is really close to feeling like Dark Souls 3, in atmosphere, design and gameplay, which just scratches a specific itch.\r\n\r\nOne thing that I have to say though, in the unlikely case that someone reads this review and decides to buy this. If you're just starting out, I'd recommend to turn OFF multiplayer. A major flaw in my opinion is the Invasion matchmaking, as you WILL be invaded by players ten times your level that you stand no chance against whatsoever.

Yes, there's occasional stutters and occasional jank. The parry is occasionally awkward and occasionally inconsistent windows. It's also possible to go in the \"wrong\" direction and be under-leveled, only to later find new areas where you're over-leveled. The lock-on system is still janky where it seems to lock onto where your *character* is facing, not the camera, meaning that when you're running around an enemy, you'll often point the camera in the wrong direction instead of locking on the enemy. The PvP mechanic can have people invading at the worst times.   \n   \nYes, this is all annoying, but if you can get through it, the game is really good. The combat is (usually) satisfying. The story is interesting, though a bit cryptic. The umbral-realm mechanic is fun. If you like souls-like games, just get it and play.\n  \nOriginal review: It's good except when it's not (in the \"bad game\" way, not the \"dark souls\" way). \"Not good\" meaning \"unintentionally annoying\" not \"intentionally difficult\". When hit boxes get screwed up (e.g. me swinging thru an invincible dog or hits catching me after successful dodges or hits that would normally stagger suddenly stop staggering) or inputs fail to register (e.g. unable to dodge right after a parry or parry not happening because the game stuttered on a boss) or when multiplayer gets weird (e.g. spawning outside a fog gate to watch my summoner slowly die) or the camera gets weird (e.g. boss appears next to a wall causing camera to go behind a curtain and you can't see anything). When any boss can one- or two-shot me, any of these jitters and bugs take any encounter from \"hard but fair\" into \"the game is literally trolling me and trying to make me angry\". Real difficulty means testing the player in a consistent way, not inconsistently messing with them in chaotic ways.

No complaints, only a few bugs, (normal) co-op worked fine. I recommend following a questline guide as it contains the same problem as normal souls-games in regards to those.\n\nUpsidedown/\"Die twice\" mechanic is pretty well done and enjoyable.

At release, the game was plagued by frustrating bugs, clunky combat, and performance issues that made what should have been a rewarding soulslike experience feel like a slog. Many players were left wondering if the remake was even worth their time.\n\nThankfully, the 2.0 update changed a lot. It brought much-needed improvements to enemy AI, smoother combat mechanics, and stability fixes that significantly reduced crashes and frame drops. The patch also polished the level design and pacing, making exploration more engaging and less tedious.\n\nThat said, even with the update, the game still struggles to fully capture the magic of its genre’s best. The story remains underwhelming, and some design choices feel dated compared to its contemporaries. But the core combat feels tighter, and the atmosphere is intact, offering a decent challenge for fans willing to give it another shot.\n\nIn the end, Lords of the Fallen remake is no masterpiece, but thanks to the 2.0 update, it’s moved from a disastrous launch to a playable and sometimes enjoyable soulslike experience.

The RPG mechanics are pretty straight forward and solid. The combat is fairly challenging but it doesn't feel so difficult that it becomes frustrating to play. If you learn the game mechanics and take your time to strategically learn and defeat each boss you can really have a fun time with this game. The art style and world of this game is really cool. The weapons and gear are cool and definitely satisfy that fanasty rpg itch. This game left me wanting more of it and I look forward to seeing what the devs do in the future.
