But as I keep playing it more and more nerfs keep happening and keep diluting the power of the original game.  The last announced update to be released complete took all my faith from this game and I can no longer support such thin backbone and breaking to the crying people.  Make the game as you want and let the people who want to play it play it.  If people think it is too hard, then let them go somewhere else and play Donkey Kong or something that holds their hand.\n\nNewest update thoughts:\n\"LMAO - quit creating \"Easy\" modes. Create the game as you want it. Let people play it as it was intended to be played.\n\nWhat is it with adding \"easy\" mode to all games???? Especially souls style game. I am a very casual player and have been playing this over time and every time a NERF is released I get angry because I wanted to be able to defeat the game as it was intended. I got to a boss and took me almost two weeks to beat. Did I switch to \"easy\" mode. HELLZ NO! I kept going. Learned the moves, learned the counters, learned the bosses move sets and patterns. And finally I demolished him and felt beyond accomplished.\n\nAlso if I wanted \"easy mode\", you have the option of using the summons... That is your option for \"easy mode\". I don't use them because I want the extra challenge. It's fine they are in there because it is part of the game and supplies the weak some support. But don't just put extra \"easy\" modes in the game because people cry.\n\nFor the crying weaklings out there: If you are stuck somewhere because you can't learn patterns, how to block, dodge, parry, etc: there is this thing called \"Farming\". It will let you level up and become stronger.... Try it and stop crying.\n\nQuit catering to the weak who do not want to put in the effort and time. And why change the default difficulty -- so ridiculous.\n\nI had hope for you all even with the \"easy\" mode. (Still don't understand to include a mode like this for this type of game, but whatever). But then you are going to do a clown update like this.

Bosses feel hard at first glance, but once you defeat them and go back to check why you were struggling, you find yourself questioning why you struggled. The game prepares you for the final fight, so the last boss doesn't even feel like a challenge; you just strive for more.\n\nThe greatest missed opportunity is the lack of ability to switch weapons (and thus fighting styles) like in Devil May Cry 5, for example, by pressing R2 on the go. Instead, you are forced to choose one weapon (base sword and axe, heavy sword, or spear; I chose spear). Every weapon has its own separate skill system, and there are not enough skill points for more than one during your first playthrough.  So, basically, you will find many interesting and beautiful weapons that you will ignore until the end of the game because you only use one, like I did.  Therefore, what is the point of limiting us to only one type of weapon (though there is no hard limit, that's just how it feels)?\n\nI want to add that this game sets a new bar in these types of games and I am really excited to see what they will come up with next.", "timestamp_created": 1749765067, "timestamp_updated": 1749765067, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Everything about the combat is fine-tuned and well-realized: comfortable controls, wide variety of moves and abilities for each weapon type, excellent animations, visual effects and sound design, just the right pace, tough but fair enemy movesets, enough room for skill expression and so on. Very satisfying to pull off longer combo strings. It all just feels amazing once you get into the groove. It has a super consistent boss lineup - they're all quite fun to fight with solid mechanics. Thematically or aesthetically they are hit or miss, with some being kind of basic, but others more original. The higher difficulty option, however, tends to be too punishing with how tanky the opponents are and how much damage they dish out if you don't have the correct set and stats on gear, and the gearing system is not something I found particularly engaging or enjoyable to min-max.\nEverything else about this game is, well... serviceable. It still has some standout moments with character designs, story cutscenes, environments / levels, music and such, especially towards the last third or so of the game. It almost felt odd to see how much more effort seems to have went into the late game stuff, with these kind of games often being more front-loaded, but Khazan starting off on the generic side while having an epic finale.\nGenerally - this is something I recommend only if you are seeking a serious combat challenge.", "timestamp_created": 1749645415, "timestamp_updated": 1749645415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.498154997825622559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

As a “Nioh-like,” it improves upon classic elements like truckloads of gear and smaller, consecutive levels by introducing a cleaner RPG progression and more sensible gear system. It is deep yet easy to understand, it looks fantastic and somehow perfectly renders an animated art style in full 3D. But it also performs exceptionally well, looking good on most settings and delivering reasonably high frames. On higher settings (Very High and above,) 8GB GPUs will encounter VRAM related hitches. Despite this, it is truly a masterclass in the Action RPG and one that deserves far more attention than it currently has. The game is well-worth full price. Ironically, my biggest complaint is that it can deliver a little TOO much time for your money. Before diving in, here’s a few things I think you should know:\r\n\r\n-The sheer volume of the game is impressive, however It’s a bit like a 7-course meal; delicious, but simply too much to be savored all at once. I can’t help thinking that my main+extra playthrough could’ve been condensed 10+ hours while enhancing my overall experience.\r\n\r\n-If you want to speed things up, realize that side quests are essential for story items but not progression. I expected to grind through side quests as they popped up like Nioh to prepare for the next main mission. 40 hours through yet only halfway through the game, I was getting sick of the grueling pace and decided to knock out main quests in quick succession. I came to discover the sheer disproportion of next-level gear in side quests versus the main story, and found it significantly quickened progression to take on side quests later. If you want to unlock the true ending or simply complete every quest, only go back to optional missions after 3-4 main ones lest you drag out the game unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n-You can re-spec, drop in and out of missions to craft new gear, redistribute skill points freely, and have access to several other headache reducers to relieve your struggle. But you cannot switch the difficulty half-way. You can endlessly experiment with your build, but easy or hard mode will stick with you forever. Act accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn sum, The First Berserker: Khazan it’s well on its way to being the best of the genre. Pacing issues aside, it masters punchy, rhythmic combat. If you like fast and deflection centric combat (almost similar to Jedi: Fallen Order), give this a look.", "timestamp_created": 1749602380, "timestamp_updated": 1749602380, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

What makes it boring in this one is that the map is just bland, there is no surprises that keeps thing refreshing.

Let me explain how:\n\nFirst and foremost, \n\nNeople, I will shamefully admit is a development team that I have never heard of until this game came along. And let me tell you, they have done an exceedingly amazing job with this. This South Korean company have made pure gold. Just simply based on playing Khazan, you can tell that they care about the people they made their games for.\n\nIs this a souls-like?\n\nI wouldn't call it a souls-like game however its a perfect blending of both Souls-like and Nioh. To me a Souls-like game is semi open world (still fairly linear) with the freedom to run about and explore, with a central hub area that you can fast travel back to at any given moment. It has the difficulty that will feel both, frustrating and rewarding, it should have the art style of gritty yet beautiful but with fairly simple build crafting and not to mention the amazing bosses. To me, that's where The First Berserker KHAZAN stops being a Souls-like and the similarities with Nioh come into play. The combat in TFBK, feels more fluid, artistic, beautiful. It's fast paced combat mixed with breath-taking combos and visceral flare of blood and violence feels like a beautiful homage to the work Team Ninja did with Nioh. \n\n\nWhat is the combat like? \n\nAs mentioned above the combat within this game is frantic, satisfying and such a rush when you blend your combos together perfectly. You have a choice of 3 weapon types those being, Dual Wield (sword and axe), Greatsword and my personal fav, Spear. Each weapon has their own unique feel to them too, the Greatsword feeling heavy, and cumbersome with bludgeoning brutal attacks. Spear being quick agile and light doing faster attacks but less damage. And the Dual wield being a blend of both previous weapons, slower than the spear but less damage than the greatsword. Each type has their own skill trees (I'll talk about those soon) which give the combat a refreshing take each time you play. The hardcoreness of the fighting and with finisher moves and cinematic camera angles that really capture the brutality of it all makes this games combat truly stand out and makes you WANT to keep coming back for more. \n\n\nThe skill trees and gear: \n\nThere are 4 skill trees within the game, there being 4 of them, are complex enough yet simple enough to master within moments. You will have the option to build into certain attack skills, reposts, visceral attacks, even perfect dodges. BUT they do create the opportunity to fully go into build crafting ensuring that your personal build could vastly differ from that of someone else simply because of 1 twist. The gear you wear. The gear system in this is not that of a Dark Souls game. As mentioned before it gives a refreshing feeling of Nioh. Your gear here, much like Nioh, allows you to truly build craft. With gear dropping very easily and often, you will spend a while farming enemies for gear to drop or materials require to craft the gear you want. Armour and accessories will have main stats and sub stats, those being, increased stamina or increased health with additional attack, critical attacks etc. Creating a build within this game is not simply, put on strongest gear and leave it alone, as your real damage and build will come from these main/sub stats. \n\n\nHow are the bosses? \n\nThis game does 2 things perfectly when it comes to the bosses that almost every other game in this genre doesn't do the first? It has the best boss difficulty progression system ever. By this I mean that the next boss you fight will always feel harder than the previous. So knowing that, it prepares you for what's to come with the next boss. And secondly, It allows you to farm bosses. And I mean, farm them. You can kill a boss at the end of the mission, then simply reload the Blade Nexus (bonfire) checkpoint of that boss and simply redo it as many times as you want. As this is how you will earn the materials needed in order to craft certain armour types for your build or for aesthetics. Some bosses will seem repeated through the side quests, however, they will still have new mechanics or feel like they are more in a frantic mode to kill you keeping you on your toes. \n\n\nHow good are the graphics? \n\nThe graphics in this game honestly can be a miss for some people. Personally I adore them because not only are they a mixture, the character/enemy models are what seems to be cellshaded, but the environments are not in this style at all and mixing the 2 styles is super pleasing on the eyes. Now, I believe as well, which some might not agree with, is the graphics also fit the narrative of the game. By that I mean, the environment doesn't pop out on the screen and the main character/enemies do, it feels like those are your targets, the only things you can see. And killing them, the blood splatter, the hyper stylized gore of it all calms down when the beauty of the background then becomes the focus. Which is what the narrative effectively is. A furious force of revenge and vengeance when needed and serene moments of character building otherwise. \n\n\nHow good is the story? \n\nNot a single spoiler or mention of it will I mention other than that which is mentioned above. The story is amazing. \n\n\nHow good are the voice actors? \n\nSimple answer? Outstanding. The main standout being that of the main character. General Khazans voice actor - Benn Starr (FF16, Away out, Wukong etc) really stands out in this. Each line is delivered with a heavy tone, mixed with pain, anger, sadness. You can tell what Khazan is thinking and feeling based on the line deliveries. Ben Starr is truly a force to be reckoned with in his field. I can honestly say I fan out now over Ben and his amazing talents. Then with Blade Phantom voiced by Anthony Howell, the gritty, seething hatred that radiates from this performance? *CHEFS KISS* In fact the entire cast, Holly Earl, Alex Brockdorff and others? All out performed and the voices tones, urgencies and softness its unbelievable. \n\n\nWhat's the soundtrack like? \n\nI beg that you just listen to it. The score for KHAZAN on its own is filled with so much grandeur, sense of power, and a hint of sadness underneath it all. The orchestra, the booming heavy beats of the drums, the sense of empowerment that builds up. Makes you actually FEEL like you can overcome it all. Whatever life throws at you, you will overcome it. I've truly never experienced a soundtrack like this.  The bosses themes as well while feeling electric if you source them out and listen to them alone, are poetic feats of beauty. If you heard them on your own without the game you would still love it. Mix in the gameplay and the feeling of defeating the bosses with that music? Dear god.  \n\n\nHow is the gameplay then? \n\nYet again, I can't think of a single flaw. I mean, is there? The game itself feels complete. Polished. Which is rare these days. The game play itself will feel slow and rough at the start, but considering what it is, it does that brilliantly. The late game when you start build crafting, transmog your gear, perfect combining your skills and launching into a full flurry of attacks into a boss, will make you feel unstoppable and have you saying \"How the hell did I do that\" and you'll be chasing that rush over and over again. You will find yourself invested in finding the collectables, as these will benefit you immensely with different perks, rewards and upgrades. \n\n\nIs there a NG+? \n\nYes.\n\n\nIs it worth buying? \n\n100%.

I love a good souls-like game\r\n2. I am familiar with the Dungeon Fighter Universe (I regularly played DFO around 15 or so years ago and really enjoyed it)\r\n\r\nFull disclosure, I have not completed the entire game yet, but I absolutely intend to. However, I do believe I have experienced virtually all of the game's core mechanics and I am confident I can speak to them without missing any major components.\r\n\r\nSo for the sake of my opinion and this review, let's talk about how this game differentiates itself from a Souls-like published by FromSoftware.\r\n\r\nLet's be a bit more specific when we say \"Souls-like\" as far as The First Berserker: Khazan goes. If you have played multiple FromSoftware titles, you know that, although similar, they each have elements that set them apart from each other mechanically. Dark Souls and Elden Ring cover scaling and deep build variety, while Bloodborne focuses more on aggressive gameplay. Sekiro, on the other hand, deals with a very deflection/parry-based combat system, which works very well for it. So where does Neople's game here fall closest to in comparison? Well, I would say it takes elements from all of these aforementioned games in some capacity. It has \"brink guarding\" which is a great parallel to Sekiro's deflection system, \"brink dodging\" which is simply leveraging i-frames to avoid damage, and is very rewarding of aggressive onslaught-focused combat, like Bloodborne.\r\n\r\nAll that being said regarding how it compares to the souls-like genre, there is something that Khazan does exceptionally well that I have not seen much of elsewhere; despite only having three main weapon types (dual wield, spear, and greatsword), the skill tree depth and skill cohesion is phenomenal. There are many skills that can be learned per weapon type that are chainable into or out of other skills, so the game's combat offers a sort of \"closed loop\" system wherein many available maneuvers synergize with others--this is, in my opinion, what really makes this game's combat shine. You can find so many interesting ways to find new combos using different moves in different orders, or optimizing how you want to dish out that DPS when fighting certain enemies you might have to change tactics for. It's an overall excellent design.\r\n\r\nIn-combat sound design. When it comes to the importance of timing and reflexes in general in a heated action game like this one, it's crucial that the audio cues and visual information are in lock-step with one another, offering the player unmistakable stimuli that you've either done something right or wrong. You'll be spending a lot of time parrying (brink guarding) and dodging enemy attacks in this game, so I greatly appreciate the developers' commitment to delivering a sound design both satisfying and conducive to understanding the flow of battle as it unfolds in often chaotic fashion that requires the player to really lock in and pay attention to the successes and failures of executing precise maneuvers to hone those critical skills necessary for this game.\r\n\r\nThe style. The game has a cel-shaded anime inspired style, and it is done extremely well. It brings a lot of color, life, and emotion to the surroundings and environment, so I certainly can appreciate the artistic approach here.\r\n\r\nAs far as style and atmosphere goes, there is one particular moment I'd like to mention that was extremely memorable for me, which was the Viper boss fight. Everything about that fight was thematically incredible to me. The arena you fight in was an open space, covered with interactive snow that tracked every step and movement during the fight, under a grim sky with a massive moon which cast mysterious, ominous light onto the set. Additionally, in the second phase of the boss fight, upon the boss using a specific move, the arena becomes extremely dark with the only part of the boss visible are the creature's bright yellow reptilian eyes, which struck a menacing, daunting, chord into the fight. Flashes of intense lightning erupted at the exact moments the creature leaped to strike, illuminating the entire arena for brief moments--it almost felt like a movie. And to top it all off, the soundtrack that played added an incredibly tense otherworldly atmosphere, with its choir singing notes of doom and struggle. All of this combined with the on-screen blizzard effects of snow and wind made for, in my opinion, one of the most breathtaking and exciting boss fight experiences I have ever had in a video game. It was truly remarkable and I would hope everyone could experience at least that in this game. Just incredible presentation.\r\n\r\nA couple criticisms:\r\n- I have spent much more time than I would like to admit sifting through gear dropped by enemies. You receive gear from defeating enemies extremely frequently, and, as someone who wants to ensure I have the best possible gear equipped as I progress, I found myself spending so much time stopping the action between fights to check out what gear, weapon, or accessory I just picked up to know if it had better rolls or was a higher level than what I currently had on, which disrupted the pacing of the game. Of course, doing what I did is not necessary, but I knew that if I didn't do this, there would eventually be hundreds of items to look at just to get rid of 99% of them, as I would only keep what's optimal. I am aware the game has a dismantling system and upgrading system for these gear pieces which ties into resource management for crafting etc, but I believe the incentive to constantly check what you are picking up from enemies every minute is too prevalent.\r\n\r\n- I know I said fantastic things about the combat system and the skill trees, and the synergy exhibited between all those skills for each weapon type (and I still maintain all this!), but I eventually reached a point in which I found myself frequently returning to the skill tree page just to kind of refresh my memory as to which skills I had equipped at the moment. Also, some of the explanations for the skills (exactly what they did or how they triggered) seemed poorly worded, or simply not explained concisely or simply enough. When the game's core mechanics rely so strongly on the player executing these skills cohesively and gracefully, I think it would serve well for the development team to put extra effort into the skills' descriptions to make comprehension extremely clear, and straightforward. I'm not saying it's overly complicated, I just believe it could have been a bit more refined; perhaps a heavier reliance on visual iconography in the skill page would be beneficial.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have been thoroughly enjoying The First Berserker: Khazan, and will continue to do so as I finish the story, and I also plan to experience the boss rush modes afterwards.\r\n\r\nNeople, thank you for this amazing game, and for creating something that has allowed me to recollect and remember some of the things I experienced in Dungeon Fighter Online when I used to regularly play. Encountering the Bard in the Forgotten Temple for the first time and realizing he is strumming his instrument to the tune of the original Dungeon Fighter character select theme was a heartwarming easter egg.", "timestamp_created": 1749062815, "timestamp_updated": 1749062815, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1749528886, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

I think that the difficulty of Khazan will be just right for someone who has beaten sekiro. Otherwise you may think Khazan is too hard as this game does not pull punches. It gives you one easy level and after that it ratchets the difficulty pretty high. Khazan is a hardcore action game that is based on deflect style gameplay and I would not suggest this game if you are looking for a button masher. \r\n\r\nThat all being said the gameplay in this game is probably some of the greatest action gameplay I have ever seen in a game. I think the only competition might be something like dmc 5. The gameplay is fast, the build variety is great. There are tons of visually distinct gear sets with set bonuses to suit your playstyle. 3 different weapons with extensive skill trees that actually matter with infinite respec.

There are also situations where you are forced to dodge or guard depending on the mechanic you're up against. This also forces you to make changes to your gameplay or sometimes even your build AND gameplay.\n\nThe transmog option comes very early in the game and i like that a lot because armors look very cool in this game and some sets give you incredible bonuses and game kind of forces you to use that but being able to change how it looks very easy and very early in the game is a cool feature in my opinion.

With so many games coming out claiming to be inspired by Dark Souls and that particular style of combat it's very difficult to find ones that are actually worth your time.\n\nSome love Nioh 1 and 2. I personally couldn't stand how uncompromising it was.\n\nSome love Lies of P. I enjoyed it for what it was but found to to be fairly uninteresting other than the art style.\n\nSome love Lord's of the Fallen: I haven't tried it but heard it only just became good recently after extensive patches and reworking so I'm nervous to even go near it.\n\nThen out of nowhere from a small time Korean studio comes The First Berserker: Khazan. New kid on the block, with a lot of stiff competition, and that needs to stand out from the crowd in order to succeed. So where does Khazan stand out? Some small positives first: \n\nThere's an actual story that you can watch and comprehend what is going on. A rarity for Souls-likes and good enough to keep your attention and stay invested in. Nothing special but the performances help carry an otherwise average revenge story.\n\nThe music is good. Bombastic and gets you hyped up in all the right ways for boss fights.\n\nThe art style is fantastic and really keeps same-y environments looking fresh.  The level design is good with a mission structure like Nioh that is just much more convenient and easier to understand at a glance. The actual missions themselves are well structured with enough branching paths to keep things interesting as well.\n\nBuild diversity is only just enough. Mainly relying on equipment providing diverse stats and weights to make a build unique. Otherwise you just have 3 styles of main weapons: Dual wielding axe and sword, Big two handed sword and by far my favourite the Spear. Pick one and stick to it. All of this is good enough to feel unique while playing but it can make things feel stale at times in a 40 hour long adventure.\n\nAll of this sounds mostly par for the course right? So where does The First Berserker: Khazan truly stand apart for the others?\n\nThe Combat and the Boss Design. Seriously. In terms of consistent quality Khazan might actually be the best souls-like and even beat a good chunk of the souls series in general. It's just that good. Parry's, or dodges can all be favoured to your preference with each holding unique advantages and both feel PERFECT. The weapons are completely unique from each other and hold completely different styles of fighting with none truly being \"better\" but all feeling chunky and brutal. Future combat is opened up with a rage mechanic and some other side systems that really help flesh the combat out.\n\nBut those bosses man. On another level. They have spectacle, difficulty and most are completely unique from each other, other than side mission bosses. Some bosses become recurring enemy types but they end up filling the normal enemy roster well, helping you feel stronger and better as you progress through the game. Like i said before though: The quality is just so consistent and most importantly FUN. There are no bad bosses, obtuse mechanics or bulldust moments of frustration....\n\nJust you and the combat. Keep going and keep getting better. Does it get repetitive? Yes it does and that's the games worst fault by far. However the combat is that consistently entertaining that, even after taking breaks to play other games for weeks apart, i could jump back in and enjoy myself just as much as I'd left. It's that intuitive and flows that well.\n\nThe First Berserker: Khazan isn't particularly unique or some out of nowhere masterpiece. But what it does well, it does better than almost all of the others in it's genre.

To the people who made this game, I wholeheartedly thank you for making this gem of a game that tested me time and time again. At the point of making this review, I am still looking for all the soul stones and jarlings in NG+, but I still have at least a few more hours to put into this game. To the few who might read this: I highly recommend this game to those who are a fan of souls-like games, looking to challenge their reflexes, and who want flexibility to fan out into an incredibly in-depth combat system.

While it can shine in many areas (and boy, does it know how to shine in those), there are also some flaws that should to be talked about.\n\nPros:\n- Combat System: The fighting in this game is absolutely phenomenal. Responsive, stylish and satisfyingly brutal. Each of the three weapon types has it's own skill tree, which enable a deep combo system that encourages aggresive and intense gameplay. Similar to Lies of P, the combat combines best of the both worlds from Sekiro (parry-based combat) and classic Souls, where dodging the enemy's attack plays a vital part. Which approach you should choose heavily depends on the situation, your build and the opponent you are facing at the moment.\n- Bosses: The bosses in this game are one of the best in the entire genre, nothing short of spectacular. Each (main-)boss is uniquely designed, hard, but, if you take your time to learn them, never unfair.\n- Difficulty: The difficulty is one of the most discussed aspects of this game. On the one hand, there is already literally an easy mode available (which does lock you out of the true ending tho). But still there are mainy claims that this game is too hard when you play it on normal, which is the way it was meant to be played by the developers. Instead of commenting on this with the obligatory \"git gud\", I'll say this: What is one of the core characteristics of a good Souls-Like? That it is meant to be hard, that you are meant to struggle and (partially) suffer. Only when you failed against a boss, again and again, each time understanding their mechanics a little more, slowly getting the timings right, gradually getting closer and closer to your goal until finally, hands-sweating, heart-pumping, you manage to defeat him - then you have truely beaten, no, mastered the boss and experienced the true meaning and beauty of the souls genre. Push your limits, apply yourself, overcome your weaknesses, git gud. The sense of accomplishment will be worth it.\nArmor sets: Armor in this game does not just supply protection against enemies or makes you look like a badass (which it does), it also grants you a variety of set bonuses in the likes of passive buffs, elemental effects or even new skills, which allow for a variety of effective builds and counterplay to certain bosses.    \n\nCons:\n- Level Design: In contrast to most souls-likes, which present a rich, interconnected world to explore (think of Dark Souls, Bloodborne), Khazan opts for a mission-based format (like Nioh). Paired with the for the most part disappointingly linear level layouts, this game fails to create the distinguished dark atmosphere for which especially the Fromsoft games are known for.  \n- Story: The plot is your run-of-the-mill revenge story. It's not terrible, but also nothing new or sensational.\n- bugs/performance: Two months after release, there are still minor bugs present in the game. Tho the developers are continually releasing new patches, it is still not entirely bug-free, but the main problems have been adressed. What on the other hand really grinds my gears: When did publishers/developers decide, that a game does not anymore have to be polished and optimized regarding performance, and that it is instead just fine to throw a pop up in your face every time you boot up the game, that you should not run this game on an HDD, but on an SSD? Don't out-source the performance problem to me, just polish your games like you are supposed to do (/rant over).  \n\nKhazan may not offer the interconnected, immersive world that other games of this genre deliver and many players crave, but it more than makes up for it through it's incredible combat system and phenomenal bosses. It is punishing but also rewarding and is at it's best when you are locked in in a life-or-death duel with one of it's amazing bosses.\n\nIf you live for great boss fights and intense action, Khazan should be your next game.", "timestamp_created": 1748505490, "timestamp_updated": 1748505490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.805260121822357178", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

They're very well designed and genuinely challenging (if you get to Viper, don't give up, it will get more manageable after that). The checkpoints are placed right next to the bosses (no more pointless runbacks).\n\n[*]Combat: Perfect dodge, perfect block, reflection (parry with a tight timing), counter attack (against \"red\" attacks, like Burst Counters in Nioh 2). Humans have white stamina bar, which regenerates quickly, whilst creatures have purple with no regen. Enemies can only be backstabbed from stealth (so no Dark Souls style backstab cheese).\n\n[*]Weapons: there are only 3 weapon types, but each has their own skill tree. Skills can be freely reallocated, which encourages experimenting with different playstyles.\n\n[*]Loot: the game uses Nioh-style (colored) loot. You'll be swimming in loot, which can be overwhelming. Weapons/armor have level and quality, and their stats can be rerolled but no +1 +2.. upgrades like in Dark Souls. There's crafting and set bonuses.\n\n[*]Leveling: you gain little improvements from level-ups, stats will mainly come from your gear and set bonuses instead. Stats can be respecced with consumables.\n\n[*]Performance: despite the UE=bad meme, the game's very well optimized, no stuttering. On an RTX3080, 1440p, Max Settings with DLSS Quality I got around 170 fps, but in some areas it dropped as low as 90.\n\n[*]Game time: 50h to 100%. unless you missed the true ending, in which case you'll have to clear the game again in NG+. Without any spoilers, you can lock yourself out of the true ending by a single dialogue option several missions before the final one. And you can't even back out of this dialogue choice without ALT+F4-ing the game. Also, retroactively setting up the criteria for the true ending does't allow you to redo the dialogue choice, which is silly.\n\n[*]Level Design: the weakest point of the game. Aesthetically nice and there are some interesting levels with good verticality, but overall it's very boring, about on par with Nioh's. Progressing through the levels is generally easy, but it's compensated by the tough bosses. I had no occasions where I would be in desperate need of the next checkpoint.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1748500355, "timestamp_updated": 1748500489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1749528637, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

The spear is the best spear combat I've felt in any souls-like (I haven't done spear in Nioh so can't judge from there), the dual wield has some satisfying combos even though it wasn't fully my style and my favorite the greatsword which is very focused on charged attacks to the point where nearly all attacks on it can be charged combined with mechanics of taking dmg while attacking to increase your dmg even further.\n\nThe combat just feels super nice. There's dodges and perfect dodges, guards and perfect guards, counter attacks and parries and you'll find yourself actually using them all to some extend. It has a bit of a blend between different other souls likes. Perfect blocking has a bit of a sekiro (though sekiro does it better as it's focused on that mechanic way more) and lies of P, perfect dodging feels like Black Myth Wukong and parries are that, parry. It also has some attacks you counter attack like Sekiro.\n\nThere is enough enemy variety till about the last two, maybe three, areas of the game. By that point you've seen it all except for the boss fights.\n\nBoss fights are the star of the show. Personally I don't think there's any bad boss fight in this game. Some feel annoying at first but once you learn them they're quite enjoyable to fight.\n\nIt has a linear mission based structure with side missions that repeat some areas you've played before and some repeat boss fights but made slightly harder. For me this isn't much of a problem.\n\nIt has item system like in Sekiro but it's a lot easier to get set bonuses and some set bonuses give you new moves that are pretty strong and insane. You might have to do some light farming to get materials though usually later on you get enough anyway, it's only if you want to use a set early that you need to farm. Just be sure if you're going for \"no summons on bosses\" achievement you don't use them to speed up farming as it'll make you miss out on it if achievements are important to you.\n\nOverall very good game.

On one hand, the game does a lot of good things. Visually, outstanding! Not only in art style, but attacks and abilities also look really good. Sound and music is decent. Ui looks very clean, most everything is very clear to understand. If you're missing items the game tells you which mission its in. Crafting and leveling gear is also pretty simple. Definitely qol you'd expect for a new souls like.\n\nLevel design is pretty boring... and some dungeons are way too long. You see a lot of the same stuff, structures and environments are mostly the same dull look. Which sort of makes sense because we really just stay in one area. Many bosses are reused with the same move sets. These were mainly side quest, but they really could have been reworked to be more fun. Its predictable theres some sort of boss at the end. Now, the first 4 or so dungeons feel great to explore... after that its like the developers got too creative in frustrating the players without testing to see if its still actually fun. I found dungeons from the 3rd and 4th zones not fun to play as I had seen most it before and the difficulty spike is extremely intense. In some cases dying means fighting all mobs again unlike elite mobs who don't respawn making deaths easier. \n\nBiggest love/hate are the boss fights which are the biggest factor. Same with dungeons, the first hand full are pretty fun. Took an average amount of attempts that lies of p or sekiro bosses would take. Then the difficulty spike goes extreme. Not only health, but attack power of bosses grow faster and well beyond your own. This can make fights last a long time, in fact too long for an action game. This is surely going to give people injuries over long play sessions. Boss mechanics are fairly simple to parry or dodge, but they all have some ability that just wipes you. After fighting for 8 minutes to just get drained is beyond frustrating. And its like its in the code for them to use these abilities when you're stamina is depleted. It just wasn't fun for me even though the fights were cool. So its either, I sucked at the game or it just didn't click for me. But if my hands hurt after a fight thats not a good game design in my opinion. I haven't had that issue in elden ring, sekiro, lies of p, stellar blade. Those all had fights that were significantly shorter with much less apm. But I also look backat those games and say man... what a great game. Khazan, I'm just like man... that was the dumbest and hardest game I've played, glad I'm done. I think some bosses could have 25% less health and the fights would be just as good and even better. I don't know, I just feel they made the game aggressively hard without asking if it was still fun.

The combat is satisfying and the game isn't too difficult, at least not until the last few areas and bosses. I only have 2 main complaints about this game, dodging and ranged bosses. Dodging in this game can feel inconsistent at times, because I would do the exact same thing when a boss attacks and one time dodge it, and the other time i'd get hit, but this might be a skill issue, so i'm willing to admit that much. However, most of the last third of the games boss fights are ranged oriented bosses. This isn't a big issue in most souls games, because you can make a build designed to do ranged attacks, but in Khazan, you only have a single ranged attack in this game, so when 95% of your damage is melee, it can get annoying when the boss is running away from you all the damn time.

[/h1]\r\n\r\n[b] Pros [/b]\r\nCombat is absolutely peak and feels amazing. Coming from Lords of the Fallen, Khazan felt like an incredible breath of fresh air. Everything plays incredibly fluidly, and the game centers around combo-ing abilities in order to succeed. Khazan very much borrows from Nioh in almost every way, but for me, it meaningfully improves on the formula. Not to mention the skill tree, which is a super nice addition—I love being able to respec for free on the fly. Such a nice quality-of-life feature.\r\n\r\nThe sound design is some of the best I've heard—everything from the parry clang to the essential enemy audio cues. There are so many rewarding sound moments as you fly around in combat doing insane stuff. This is a good thing, because you’ll be hearing the sound of your weapon repeatedly as you wail on the boss over and over and over again (more on this later).\r\n\r\nAll the armor choices truly feel impactful and can be crafted to completely change how you play the game (including unique abilities, which is typically poggers). Plus, you can play the fashion game while still rocking your OP set. The way you can hone in attributes and level gear is also very, very welcome and fits well with other aspects of the game where the devs chose to be smart instead of punishing with resource costs. You can very easily beat this game without farming. Finally, there’s a point in the game where mixing and matching feels like a viable option without wrecking your build.\r\n\r\n[b] Cons [/b]\r\nEasily the biggest weakness of the game is the story and its characters. It’s very forgettable—unless you’re really into gooning over anime chicks (of which there is no shortage in this game). The plot is extremely tired and drags on way too long with very little reprieve or variety. It's not distractingly bad, but it definitely gets in the way of where the game shines.\r\n\r\nThis has been mentioned in a number of other reviews, but the bosses are, at times, truly a grueling, unnecessary marathon. This is especially true in the early game, where it feels like your commitment and patience are tested more than your actual “skill” at the game. You're forced to learn every mechanic and niche of the fight and frequently be tested with near-perfect execution. More often than not, it becomes about how long you can stun-lock a boss with combos and attacks; and a run can be completely ruined if your combo breaks. There’s a place for this kind of challenge in the genre, but I’d really warn casual players. Thankfully, this flattens out in the midgame (and most of the lategame) as more combat options open up to you. If you have a full-time job and a kid, Khazan may not be for you.\r\n\r\nFor a $60 game, only having three weapons at your disposal doesn’t feel quite right. All weapons play very differently, which is awesome, but I would expect more variety right out of the gate—especially when visual models like a giant hammer already exist in the game for brutal attacks, etc.\r\n\r\n[b] Mild, totally subjective gripes [/b]\r\nIt would be fantastic to get some extended i-frames after a brutal attack. You frequently get punished shortly after killing an enemy, which can be super annoying. I’d even go as far as to say I’d spend a skill point to gain this.\r\n\r\nThe Bard set is extremely silly and should probably be giga-nerfed. Maybe it shouldn’t have normal stats outside of set bonuses, or it should come with a drawback like taking 25% more damage. The positives WAY outweigh the negatives and let you coast through mobbing while raking in above-average rewards. In my opinion, this trivializes the game and lets you organically get way ahead.\r\n\r\nFor me, Javelin also contributes to “easy mode” during mobbing. The majority of elite enemies can be dealt with before the fight even starts most of the time. Some of the stuff you can do is cool, but it feels extremely overtuned. Maybe scale back the damage dramatically and make them more of a boss mechanic—like being used to hit weak points for stamina damage, etc.\r\n\r\nDelete throwables. Some bosses can literally be killed by throwing one round of each throwable. It’s bizarre to have some fights be so punishing and others be easily dismantled with “free” items.

Normally, we'd much rather buff the skills and styles that aren't getting much love, but with Trance, the power gap had grown so wide that we couldn't avoid toning it down.\n\nI'm genuinely sorry this has caused frustration and disappointment.

I haven't died more than three times on any boss (just beat the spider), and just once during one of the levels. This tells me that the greatsword really just isn't powerful enough; as slow as it is, it needs to be better balanced to hit harder OR, ideally, it should do massive stamina/stance damage. Anyway.... I still don't recommend the game for anyone but hardcore soulslike fans due to the balance issues and poorly designed late-game bosses. Here's the original review:\n\n---------------------\n\nIt breaks my heart to write a negative review of a game I've gotten a lot of joy from, but after 60+ hours and toiling away on a ludicrously overlong and terribly designed final boss, I've just had enough. The payoffs have simply not been worth the hours of frustration and difficulty, especially the bosses.\n\nMy soulslike experience is limited: some time in Sekiro, some in Elden Ring, but Lies Of P is one of my all-time favorite games, and I've beaten it five or six times. Recently, I finished Wukong: The Black Myth, but I haven't had much interest in replaying it. But those will be my primary basis for comparison with Khazan. I don't make any claims of being some great gamer, but I'm not one to shy away from a good challenge.\n\nThe combat in Khazan, generally, feels excellent. Combos feel impressively devastating, and when you start trivializing enemies it's a great feeling. \"Reflect\" is absolutely one of the best ideas ever in a game and feels immensely satisfying to use. Khazan gets so much of the moment to moment gameplay just right: the parry system is fantastic — not quite as demanding as Lies Of P, and for the better. Like Wukong, it also has a perfect dodge. And like many soulslikes, you can break your opponent's stance and unleash a high-damage attack with a button prompt.\n\nHere's the deal, and yeah, I'm gonna be that person: this game is too hard. \n\nMaking a game difficult isn't hard or clever; you can just crank up the damage output of enemies, and make them tanks. The real challenge is making difficult boss fights both interesting and rewarding, and Khazan just drops the ball way too many times here, instead just making the bosses tanks that take far too long to kill and deal out far too much damage.\n\nThe worst offenders, by far, are bosses like Trokka and the absolutely atrociously bad final boss, Ozma. I will never understand why developers build a whole game around melee combat, then create bosses that literally spend the majority of the fighting running away from you and shooting extremely powerful, fast projectiles. It's not fun, and it's not why I play a game like this. I'll be honest: after struggling for a solid 30 minutes and barely making a dent in Trokka, I knew that I didn't want to spend another 3-4 hours on her as I had Maluca (who was actually a great boss). It's just cheap, overlong, and frustrating. So I turned the difficulty to \"easy,\" and it still took me over a dozen tries. \n\n\"Overlong\" is a problem with all of the boss fights. In Lies Of P, the bosses were tough, but the challenge lay in understanding their moves so you could parry them and break their stance to unleash a high-damage attack. Often, when you would finally win, you would absolutely slaughter the boss because you could quickly stagger them. While Khazan has this mechanic, it lacks the reward — the button-prompt combo hardly does any more damage than a regular attack. It feels defeating to meticulously learn a boss's moves, parry the majority of them to whittle away at their stamina bar, but still die because every boss has an absolutely gargantuan health bar and their attacks deal massive damage — often with status effects, too. And don't forget that those bosses who constantly retreat from you also regenerate their stamina, making them extremely difficult to stagger.\n\nBosses also have a number of vaguely telegraphed AOE attacks and, my least favorite, unblockable grab attacks. These were poorly implemented and horribly overused in Wukong to the game's detriment, and while they're not as bad here (they're better telegraphed and thus don't feel as cheap) they seemingly exist only to frustrate players.\n\nI got so exhausted from every boss — even the ones in side missions — taking 3-4 hours to beat that I just started turning the difficulty to easy for every boss later in the game. They were still plenty hard, with Hizmar taking me several hours to beat despite the reduced difficulty. \n\nBy the end of it, I was just done. The final boss is three phases. Twice, I died on the third phase, meaning that's 20+ minutes down the drain. On easy mode. Toiling away at every boss for hours and hours, memorizing every single move to avoid even the smallest mistake because you are punished hard, against bosses with massive health bars who are immune to throwables and often simply retreat out of range and unleash attacks that are nearly impossible to dodge.... is this fun? Is this why I play video games? \n\nThere's a certain level of frustration that's worth it. Lies Of P pushed me hard that way, but by the end of the first playthrough I couldn't wait to play again. But that's also because for the most part, I liked the bosses in Lies Of P — especially Laxasia and the Nameless Puppet, with their near-constant trading of attacks and parries. But Khazan overplays its hand, and the tanky bosses don't feel like momentous occasions — they feel like an annoyance I want to get past.\n\nThe world is, unfortunately, largely drab and uninteresting, with repetitive textures and locations with a bland, desaturated palette. There is some very nice art design later in the game, but the middle portion is full of repetitive caves, dungeons, villages, and castles. I was actually able to follow the story (more than I can say for Wukong), and while it's well-told, the game simply didn't instill that sense of danger and urgency that Lies Of P did, nor was it as touching or evocative.\n\nKhazan had a good run for me. I got several dozen hours of enjoyment out of it, But just as Wukong fell apart in the last chapter with terrible world design and a barrage of egregiously bad bosses, Khazan also devolves into a slugfest where the extreme difficulty doesn't have any payoff. I should feel triumphant when I beat a boss, not relieved that I can get back to the parts of the game I was enjoying. The last boss is so badly designed, so utterly unenjoyable, tedious, cheap, and overlong, that even on easy it was no longer worth the effort. Could I farm for legendary gear and keep trying? Could I just be persistent and beat him eventually? Could I watch a bunch of videos with tricks and tips to beat him? Sure, but why go through all that trouble for a boss fight I don't enjoy at all?  I mean really, if I haven't conveyed enough how much I dislike this boss, I uninstalled the game because I genuinely have no interest in repeating such an atrociously, insultingly bad boss fight.\n\nSo despite my positive early impressions and some brilliant mechanics, I think Khazan ultimately falters under the weight of trying out-hardcore other soulslikes. And, just for the record, a friend of mine also purchased Khazan, and unlike me he is a diehard fan of the genre. He's beaten every Fromsoft game and most of the soulslikes. He quit Khazan because of the difficulty.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1748322738, "timestamp_updated": 1748444215, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554319858551025391", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1748859210, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

This game blew me away. I went in expecting awesome combat and a one-note story, but to my surprise I was *invested*. What starts out as a bloodbath revenge tale starts to unravel into multiple plots that involve relationships, loss, tragedy, and the arcane.\n\nKhazan is an awesome main character. He starts out as like the badass doom-guy who just wants to murder every living thing that wronged him, but as you do the side missions you start to learn he was a truly good guy, a respected leader and a caring friend. He is also very to the point and no nonsense which makes him even cooler. The voice actor did an amazing job too, he suits him perfectly!\n\nBesides the story, man the combat in this game is insanely cool and so much fun. If I had to summarise it, it really does feel like a Doom Eternal soulslike. I played the great sword exclusively throughout the whole story and it was sick. You get so many cool skills that at first just feel like flashy damage moves but end up being strategic as you get more comfortable with your weapon. Not to mention the brutal/execution attacks, MAN. I swear I saw like at least 20 unique animations of Khazan ripping different enemies in half. The sound design of this game enhances it even further by making every kill, every clash of metal, and every step so satisfying. Especially all the parrying and greatsword clanking sounds.\n\nThe level design was always smart and fun to navigate, but I think the highlight of this game is the bosses. These bosses are some of the most incredible I've seen in video games ever. They were amazing set-pieces, with brutally difficult (but super-fun by the end) patterns, some with jaw-dropping backing tracks. I'm getting chills just thinking about some of the last few songs!!\n\nI think if you like souls games, you can't miss this one.

Other soulsbornes I have played: DS1, DS3, Elden Ring, Bloodborne, Lies of P, Another Crab's Treasure so you know the perspective I have\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n-Lacrima rewards for Boss progress is probably my top praise for this game, even if youre only getting two hits in eventually you will get a level or two to boost stats and confidence\r\n-Combat is smooth and adaptable to my playstyle through the skill tree\r\n-skill tree system is good, feels like as im getting better as a player khazan has more and more skills for me to play with.\r\n-Game long - lots of content. Took me 70 hours on normal difficulty, greatsword no summons \r\n-Controversial take is that MOST of the bosses have appropriate health pools, Yes they are mountains of HP but they are bosses. I found great satisfaction in seeing the difference between running into a boss arena for the first time and getting two hits before getting wrecked and then eventually being able to brink and counter all their moves because I observed and i learned.\r\n-Good variety of bosses overall, four mages stacked at the end lowkey cringe \r\n-I liked the optional mission bosses usually being main boss re-fights. A little callback to someone you already conquered so they aren't insanely difficult\r\n-Netherstones and Jarlings encourage exploring every inch of a stage which is something i try to do naturally\r\n-NPCs had at least some personality, wish they had more involvement in gameplay other than hi there tristan and oh no bye Elamein\r\n-Blade Phantom. he's cool. \r\n-Cinematics after boss defeats were a nice additional reward to winning and getting to see the lore/story unfold\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n-Achievements bugged. i have true ending achievement but not reese or princess music rapier achievements\r\n-Story is fine, i'm still not sure who said Khazan was a traitor cuz originally the story says the emperor or someone did it but then they said it was Ozma who said Khazan was the traitor but then the final cutscene shows Ozma being labeled a traitor i guess because of what the guards did but then Khazan got implicated as a traitor as well??? many such cases\r\n-Reese as a concept is introduced way too late in the story for being Khazan's second best friend. I guess we see her in the opening cinematic with Ozma crying over her but it felt like Ozma was mentioned minute one and Reese was first mentioned as i'm opening the doors to her arena\r\n-I avoided the rerolling and upgrading gear for a while because I didnt really understand it, maybe i missed something or maybe it coulda been explained better\r\n-Healing enemies whether they're mini bosses or Maluca or OZMA pondering his stupid ORB make me sad. I genuinely dont know what to do against ozma's orb and couldnt figure it out womp womp\r\n-Skill Tree is good, but I did not want a single move that i had to map myself. I picked all passives and moves with predetermined inputs. This led me to kinda just having a handful of skill points at the end of the game with nothing to put them into \r\n-Blade Phantom pulls out a giant hammer in his fight. Being a Monster Hunter hammer main, I want a hammer! Greatsword had to do but man i wanted bonk stick.\r\n-Holding an achievement behind the spirit of advocacy is kinda ehhhhh. I summoned a spirit one time against viper without knowing about the achievement. I guess it only counts it if you beat the boss when summoning the spirit\r\n-Also didnt realize right away that to craft gear i would have to disassemble other gear. I was just like man i have no materials guess they're just rare drops\r\n-returning to missions and having doors/gates/shortcuts blocked is so annoying when trying to find missed jarlings and netherstones. Finding netherstones was easiest if i ran from the boss arena back to the starting area but man so many things were closed\r\n-Did we really need the same enemy as the main boss as the 99th owl and that one other guy in two different optional missions?\r\n-No crafting higher level/rarity rings/charms of resistance is weird\r\n-Elemental potions and other consumables i never used cuz uhhh\r\n-What is earth resistance? what is earth? is it poison?\r\n-Couldnt find what Trokka's Jellyfish debuff was inside the game, wish it was in the ailments page\r\n-The hermit's cave and all that stuff felt so out of place for the overall game like ok we have this path and you gotta branch off to go through monkeyville and then fight big horned bear and then teleport back to the start and go through spiderville so you can go through poison zone and then go back to the start and then go right through plagueville and undeadland so you can teleport back to the beginning and fight madame ghost summon.\r\n-8 heals for 3 phases of Ozma is BRUTAL. I had to equip the chaos set that gave regeneration on brink guard.\r\n-Demo weapon had insane scaling, didnt swap off it until very late game cuz there was no incentive to.\r\n\r\nI feel like i have a lot of critiques for this but dont let that distract you from the fact that I did enjoy playing. Guess gamers are never happy and if i dont like every single thing i should go back to playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure and wearing my propeller beanie", "timestamp_created": 1748139595, "timestamp_updated": 1748139595, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

The main problem of Khazan is that it doesn’t have its own vision - just a basic fantasy setting with goblins, spiders, skeletons, and a pinch of a revenge plot in the background. You can clearly see how all of the resources went into the combat system, which resulted in a brutal-ish spectacle where every blow is accompanied by a dopamine-inducing impact. It’s very hard to complain from a gameplay perspective because it works - and it fucks.\n\nTrust me, you will like it - especially knowing that it focuses only on 3 types of weapons, with a decent amount of skills, combos, and buffs for each type. And you can reset skills anytime you want! And yes, it’s not a Soulslike - more like a Nioh-like, where fights require precision and aggression towards foes.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t take a defensive approach by applying parry for every attack. Yeah, it has parries - [i]\"One of the worst mechanics in recent years\"[/i] or something like that. Hate it or like it, but it’s the main basis of the game, and I have good news for you: there are two types of parries, but you can basically dodge everything if you’re not a fan of defensive playstyles. So you can either use only dodging or combine a little bit of everything to succeed against the hardest aspect of the game - bosses.\n\nI don’t want to say that they’re hard - pretty much passable and fair - where the originality comes from the fight itself [i](unfortunately, not from the design of them)[/i]. On normal difficulty, the only problem for me was the amount of HP they had, which leads to the longevity of the battle. Still, bosses are the highlight of the game - except for mages and their [i]\"let me fly away for a few minutes so I can spam you with shitless amounts of projectiles.\"[/i]\n\nI would say Khazan feels like a boss rush game with a massive amount of filler represented by the levels themselves, where you’ll pray to get another battle so you can forget for a second that there’s a shallow catacomb level on your way. Not the middest game I’ve played - pretty cool, especially the bosses.

This is their first souls/nioh like game and I have already enjoyed it much more than I have enjoyed any other From Software game! The reason being that the devs have implemented almost every quality of life feature that I was dying for From Software to add in all their games. I would surely give it a 10/10.\n\nPros :\na) The combat is fucking amazing. Having to use multiple skills for different scenarios feels badass and is something I never experienced in any souls game. And you can either just parry or just guard or do a combination. Combat is also very fluid!\n\nb) Quality of life features are everywhere. Run from lamp to boss takes 2-5 seconds with only one boss run so far taking 7-8 seconds which is nothing compared to the 1 minute runs in From Software games especially Bloodborne.\n\nc) No stupid 60 fps lock unlike From Soft's games. This is such a bare-minimum 'feature' that even indie games have.\n\nd) UI is pretty good and intuitive unlike From Soft's games. Everything is explained so nicely. Skills window shows videos for each skill on hover. Descriptions in the legends are pretty good.\n\ne)  Graphics are top notch. The game looks amazing and the optimization is pretty good too. I am playing at the highest graphics settings on a 4060 laptop with frame gen and dlss activated and i get 120-140 fps easily. Massive stutters that last 2 seconds happen very very rarely. \n\nf) Bosses are hard but fun. The moves are very readable and it feels satisfying to beat them. For me personally, the very short runs from respawn point to the boss makes boss fights very enjoyable. No one wants to play a running simulator before fighting a boss. I love having to figure out what skills to use. I constantly keep changing skills to better suit my weapons or the boss.\n\ng) There is no stupid 'dodge getting triggered on button release instead of button press' mechanic unlike in FromSoft's games. Imagine triggering dodge which is the most important mechanic in the game on a button release when you have to dodge fast attacks.\n\nCons : Can't think of any major point but will update once I finish the game.\n\nThe devs are surely fans of souls games because its very apparent by the fact that they borrowed  a handful of gameplay elements from From Soft's games but they were also clever enough to omit many stupid annoying shit from those games. This review might make it seem that I hate From Soft but I hate only how archaic and stupid they are when it comes to implementing some stuff. I hope that they can play this game and change their stupid ways.

Whether [b]parrying, dodging, or guarding[/b], I could adapt my combat approach depending on the fight.\r\n\r\nI’ve played Souls games [b]a lot[/b], so I expected a challenge—but Khazan pushes things even further, demanding [b]precision, aggression, and endurance[/b].\r\n\r\n[h2]Combat: Fluid, Adaptive, and Brutal[/h2]\r\nCombat in Khazan is [b]one of the best I’ve played[/b], but its [b]mechanical balancing struggles in late-game fights[/b]. [b]Brink Guard (parry)[/b] is tight, rewarding precise timing, but stamina depletion and HP scaling issues hold the experience back.\r\n\r\nI relied on [b]dual wield and spear[/b], with spear becoming my go-to for its [b]speed, range, and ability to extend Moonlight uptime[/b]. [b]Moonlight activation requires landing three consecutive Swift Attacks[/b], but if I was interrupted, I had to [b]restart the sequence entirely[/b] before I could chain into [b]Assault or Reversal[/b]. Even when I successfully executed the combo, [b]stamina drained too quickly[/b], making fights against [b]status-inflicting mobs (Poison, Flame, Chaos)[/b] particularly punishing.\r\n\r\nLate-game enemy HP [b]bloated so much that fights became exhausting endurance tests[/b], forcing players into prolonged encounters that felt more about survival than skill. The [b]weapon kits for dual wield, spear, and greatsword need adjustments[/b]—for instance, the execution speed of [b]greatsword attacks[/b] is [b]too rigid[/b], locking players into [b]predictable sequences[/b] that struggle in high-pressure battles.\r\n\r\nTo counterbalance this, the [b]upkeep for chained maneuvers needs reworking[/b], allowing [b]Moonlight extensions to flow into Assault/Reversal, then into additional multi-hit skills[/b], creating [b]a more consistent offensive rhythm[/b] rather than forcing constant resets. However, even if players successfully execute these chains, [b]stamina drains far too quickly[/b], limiting engagement and further amplifying the difficulty gap against enemies with [b]excessive HP scaling[/b].\r\n\r\nA [b]reduction in stamina depletion[/b], paired with [b]improved chaining of multi-hit attacks[/b], would help [b]shift combat toward mastery rather than endurance[/b], ensuring weapon abilities feel [b]responsive, rewarding, and competitive against high-health foes[/b]. Without these adjustments, fights continue to feel [b]drawn-out and imbalanced[/b], requiring excessive effort for limited payoff.\r\n\r\nUsing [b]greatsword[/b], I often felt like I was [b]backseating the fight[/b], holding a defensive stance and [b]waiting for an opportunity to strike instead of actively engaging[/b]. This was especially noticeable against [b]quick-attacking enemies like Viper[/b], whose relentless speed [b]forced me into a reactionary role[/b], struggling to find clean openings. The [b]slower execution of greatsword attacks[/b] meant [b]enemies interrupted me before I could land a decisive hit[/b], turning encounters into [b]drawn-out battles of attrition rather than rewarding duels[/b]. Instead of feeling empowered, I was [b]waiting for my turn[/b], which [b]broke the momentum[/b] of combat.\r\n\r\n[h2]Bosses: Ozma Sets the Bar, Others Lag Behind[/h2]\r\nThere’s no debate—[b]Ozma is the best boss fight I’ve ever played[/b].\r\n\r\nHis [b]multi-phase battle constantly forced me to adapt[/b]. [b]Missile barrages[/b] kept me moving, explosions cutting off escape routes, while his [b]relentless slashes and lunges demanded perfect Brink Guard timing[/b]. [b]Sweeping combos baited dodges[/b], making counters crucial. Unlike many late-game encounters that relied on [b]high HP to stretch out difficulty[/b], [b]Ozma’s challenge came entirely from his mechanics[/b], making the fight thrilling instead of exhausting.\r\n\r\nOther bosses didn’t reach this level. [b]Too many relied on status effects instead of innovative attack sequences[/b], and [b]delayed attacks became frustrating rather than rewarding[/b]. The [b]bloated HP pools[/b] dragged out encounters, replacing strategy with endurance grinding.\r\n\r\n[h2]World & Art Direction: Stunning Aesthetics, Flawed Design[/h2]\r\nExploring Khazan wasn’t always engaging. [b]Stormpass and Mount Heinmach lacked atmosphere[/b], feeling [b]more like obstacles than immersive locations[/b]. The [b]early game is repetitive[/b], improving later but never fully delivering.\r\n\r\nEnemy placement frustrated me. [b]Archers behind elites, exploding spiders, and relentless gank squads[/b] turned encounters into frustrating battles rather than skillful duels. This issue was [b]clear right from the tutorial[/b], where the game [b]introduces archers/shooters placed behind mobs[/b], foreshadowing the [b]artificial difficulty padding seen throughout[/b].\r\n\r\nThat said, the [b]art direction is phenomenal[/b]. [b]Cel-shaded character designs against realistic backgrounds create a unique, visually striking look[/b]. [b]Bruises and cuts stay on enemies as I fight them[/b], adding a brutal touch that enhances the sense of impact in every battle.\r\n\r\nOnce again, this game proves that [b]art style matters more than chasing realism[/b]. Korean developers have been [b]putting out incredible titles[/b], with Lies of P, Sanabi, and Dave the Diver all pushing distinct aesthetics. Khazan follows that trend beautifully.\r\n\r\n[h2]Loot & Progression: Unbalanced and Lacking Basic QoL Features[/h2]\r\nCrafting [b]wasn’t worth the effort[/b]. [b]Loot drops constantly outclassed crafted gear[/b], making upgrading [b]pointless minutes after grinding materials[/b]. The [b]Diablo-style loot mechanics[/b] clashed with Khazan’s Soulslike systems, making build progression [b]feel more dependent on random drops than planning[/b].\r\n\r\nOn top of this, the [b]inventory management system needs a serious overhaul[/b]. [b]Sorting weapons and armor by set would make comparing stats much easier[/b]—right now, flipping between helmets, chest pieces, and attributes feels clunky. Being able to [b]view all equipment from the same set side by side[/b] would help with making meaningful loadout decisions rather than constantly jumping between individual items.\r\n\r\n[h2]Story: Functional, But Forgettable[/h2]\r\nThe story wasn’t bad, but it [b]lacked depth[/b]. I hoped for something layered, like Elden Ring, where [b]lore unfolds naturally through exploration[/b]. Instead, Khazan [b]relies on straightforward cutscenes[/b], making the narrative feel [b]surface-level rather than immersive[/b].\r\n\r\n[h2]Final Verdict: Combat Excellence Held Back by Flaws[/h2]\r\nDespite its issues, Khazan [b]kept me hooked[/b], especially in the fights that delivered.\r\n\r\n[b]Ozma’s battle alone makes this game worth playing[/b], setting a new standard for what a Soulslike boss should be. The [b]combat system is exhilarating[/b], rewarding fast reactions and perfect execution. But [b]bloated enemy HP, stamina depletion issues, repetitive level design, frustrating enemy placements, and an unbalanced loot system[/b] prevent Khazan from reaching true greatness.\r\n\r\nThis game [b]punishes mistakes and demands endurance—but when it clicks, it’s an absolute thrill[/b].\r\n\r\n[b]Final Score: 8.5/10[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1747707983, "timestamp_updated": 1747724521, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.579516947269439697", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1748858924, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

Its simply too hard. \n\nThe game encourages you somewhat to try a boss multiple times by rewarding you with skill points and some leveling currency each try, but its just not enough. After trying a boss for a few hours, you'll eventually hit a hard cap where the game tells you you cant get any stronger until you complete the mission by beating the boss, effectively forcing you to just \"get good\". In addition, the bosses scale with you in level so the only thing you actually get by trying them over and over is skill points, which again, the game completely cuts you off from after a certain point.\n\nThe game has A LOT of really cool abilities, which would be a plus, but the problem is theres never really a pause in attacks for you to actually use any of the neat combos, other than the one or two times a fight where the boss is drained of poise, and even that's only for a few seconds. If you look up and guides on how to beat a certain boss (which i guarantee you will playing this) you'll notice a pattern. Its usually people recommending one move to spam the entire fight, or avoiding hitting them all together since its too risky because the fights last so long and a single mistake could cost you the entire 15 minute boss fight. \n\nI'm only on the 4th boss, and after spending 5 hours trying to beat the last one only to be given maybe a 1 hour break by traversing a new map and picking up a few nearly useless consumables, i simply don't have the heart to put in another 5+ hours trying to beat this one.\n\nIt really is a shame because the foundation for a good game is there, but its just such a chore to run the same boss hoping you don't make a single mistake.\n\nWould not recommend even as a souls fan.", "timestamp_created": 1747674176, "timestamp_updated": 1747676722, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493773698806762695", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1748858875, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

Seriously, folks, do the side missions.\n* Boss fights are varied, but each one has a predictable learning curve, so you always feel like you're making progress\n* Just the right amount of collectibles and optional content (bonus training rewards, etc.)\n* Practice room to test out new builds\n* High skill ceiling (eg, Reflection) but accessible to all (eg, Guard/Dodge and Brink Guard/Dodge)\n\nIt's not an easy game by any stretch of the imagination, but I never felt like it was unfair.\n\nLike I said, it isn't perfect, so if I could change a few things, it would be this:\n\n* Some of the bosses are a little spongy.\n* Inventory management could use a little more work, which I think is already planned.  Specifically, we need to be able to sort by armor set, and I'd also like to see things like throwables on their own tab.\n* The Phantom Form mechanic sucks as it is currently implemented, as do the Phantom \"Abilities\".  They need to merge the two together, drop the passive effect (everyone just uses Keshta), and make the Phantom Form a special move that changes depending on what Phantom you have selected.\n* The skill trees should have dedicated points for each weapon instead of being a global pool.  Get rid of the Common tree altogether.\n* Finally, the five primary stats need to be reworked so they work with all weapons instead of the current funky weapon scaling that means you should respec each time you change weapons.\n\nA better way to do would be:\n\nVitality - Increases health\nEndurance - Increases stamina\nStrength - Increases weapon damage and carry weight\nWillpower - Reduces damage taken\nProficiency - Increases damage done with javelin/throwables\n\nThis would allow people to tailor their builds to their play style and freely swap between the weapons without having to redo their skill tree every time and stats every time.  After you progress to a certain point in the game, you basically have unlimited respecs, so there's no point in making it just a tedious chore.\n\nHaving said all that, I had a total blast in the game, and I am absolutely looking forward to the next game these developers come up with.", "timestamp_created": 1747633440, "timestamp_updated": 1747633440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1748858837, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

The combat is amazing, some of the most fun in the genre for sure. The decision to give some XP every time you attempt a boss, and to put your dropped XP outside the door should become genre staples. However, a million little things add up to be extremely frustrating and detract from the game. A lot of reused bosses again and again (one lore scroll has a voice acted line going \"Is that BOSS? No, it's his brother, BOSS2\"), some frustrating fights mixed in with mostly really well done fights, certain crafting items (Water Resistance Parchment - resistance NOT cleanse) are straight up not obtainable as far as I can tell, the gear upgrade system is bafflingly bad, they have stated that they have no ability to make shortcuts persistent (they are adding some QoL teleports and stuff to mitigate this but it's a bandaid at best) so going back to levels for collectibles is awful, bad soulslike \"platforming\" (falling) segments, occasional issues with the camera. I definitely intend to finish the game, but as my playthrough has gone on I have become more and more surprised at the level of praise the game got. Excellent combat and mostly good boss design definitely carry the experience, but the number of small issues (not even to get into game breaking bugs or performance issues, which are rare but not completely absent) didn't turn up in any of the many reviews I read. I love a good soulslike and I especially love Ben Starr so I hope the game gets some refinement, and maybe a sequel where you don't fight the same boss 3 times. \r\n\r\nI also purchased the Deluxe Edition since it explicitly states the gear can be used for transmog and can be upgraded (and I wanted to support a very cool looking new game, which I don't regret). The most recent patch made the first part more accurate, previously transmog was NG+ exclusive, so shout out to the devs on that one. Upgrading it is possible as well, but due to the terrible upgrade system even without having to grind for materials it basically goes up one level at a time so by the time you unlock the upgrade system it would take dozens of times going through the upgrade window with dozens of items in the same slot, for each piece. By the time I wanted to try the set out, I was level ~75 and the DLC gear was level ~25. Even using a level 75 piece to upgrade got it 1 level at a time (I did see 2 once) so I gave up on it rather than go through the upgrade button presses 50 times for each of 6 pieces of gear. Then, upgrading gear does not increase the randomly rolled stats, you have to reroll them and they'll reroll at the new level. The desire to craft and reroll my loot is hugely diminished because every 10 levels or so I would have to randomly roll the stats repeatedly to try for the same things.", "timestamp_created": 1747609613, "timestamp_updated": 1747609613, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550000011920928955", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Most negative reviews I have seen so far complain about high health bars on bosses, but I feel that it fits this games combat a whole lot more.

When i first Fought Chaos I was confused because of how easy the first phase was, then i died repeatedly for the next hour from how brutal that fight was. But eventually I figured out his patterns and beat him with 1 hp and no heals left. I then beat him 7 times in a row without running out of heals afterwards because I understood him and his attacks.

Great feedback for every single hit,  perfect parry and dodge.\nSome phenomenal boss fights, a very high skill ceiling and super fun to engage with all the in-game mechanics, which if you don't you will end up like all the reviews calling bosses 'overtuned' or that they have too much health. \n\nEvery weapon has its separate skill tree, which makes even the per-weapon build diversity great when you add set bonuses from armors. By the late game I was shredding the final few bosses and had lots of fun learning their movesets. Freely being able to reassign level points and weapon skill points is really nice. \n\nWould have still preferred a more crisp and original 25-35 hour experience. Wish bosses and levels were not reused as often in the side missions, but I enjoyed them nonetheless for some key items and lore locked behind them. I should also mention that completing every node/mission 100% gives you extra points to spend towards increasing weapon damage, which a lot of people seem to outright forget about when I have seen them play. \n\nPerhaps the game could have done better to tutorialize some of these things, but given how much glaze FromSoft gets for never holding your hand through learning mechanics, I'm sure people will feel right at home. \n\nThe story while being predictable once you're around the halfway mark, stays consistent and rarely feels half baked in its delivery which is rare for the genre. A great sense of continued narrative that is helped by it being a linear mission based game, and expanded on really well by the side missions.\n\nEasily one of the most rewarding games of its kind, and my personal game of the year thus far.", "timestamp_created": 1747254333, "timestamp_updated": 1747255042, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1747647218, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

For example, this game does feature a stamina bar for bosses, which can be depleted by performing perfect parries or blocks (which are easy to do and very satisfying). The game also has a really smooth dodge system as well, so there's 3 ways you can run defense that all have their pros and cons. I feel the combat is much more intense and interesting that Elden Ring or Dark Souls.\n\nThere are 3 main weapon types you can choose for your journey, each with its own completely unique moveset and abilities (greatsword, sword/axe, spear), that's it, no silly magic or anything. This promotes replayability because you can do one playthrough with one weapon, and again with another. It's very easy to re-roll stats if you change your mind at any point in the game, as it's not viable to use more than one due to how the skill trees work.\n\nThe combat is much more gripping and intense than other Souls games, with the addition of Phantom abilities, different combos to play around with, and a very neat skill leveling system that really gives you freedom and creativity in combat. Its not just a dodge-roll-smack-dodge-roll smack type of combat, its a real back-n-forth battle that is fast paced and brutal.\n\n The art design is very unique too, with characters having that \"3d anime\" look, but the environments are all dark, detailed, and realistic\n\nThe story, while not deeply layered or full of plot twists, is a great vengeance story that has you partner up with a literal demon that has his own unique personality, all the side characters have phenomenal voice acting as well\n\nBoss fights are difficult, but the game gives you plenty of tools to counter that, and i'm never dying to some bullshit. You learn where you faulted, and come back a little bit smarter everytime. The vast array of combat items and abilities let you pinpoint the boss' weakness or create a good flow in your fight. (Oh this guy is weak to fire but MUCH weaker with lightning) \n\nThe game has alot of side missions that have their own little storylines to them, and while sometimes they re-use the main maps and bosses from earlier, they do put a little twist to them, but I'm just grateful that there's extra bosses to fight.\n\nSound design is impeccable, the sound of your greatsword smacking an enemy, perfect blocking/parrying, enemy sounds, ambient noises etc.\n\nThe game is void of any woke agenda, is straight to the point, there's no 40 minute video on Youtube you need to watch to understand what's going on. I'm loving every second of it and will start my second playthrough with the spear (the greatsword is easily my favorite and easiest to use)\n\nLove this game, would love to see a 2nd installment some day or some DLC. I honestly think it does alot of things better than most other Souls games, the only thing Elden Ring does better is that its fully free roam, but that's about it", "timestamp_created": 1747166012, "timestamp_updated": 1749512982, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1747306401, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

They're tough but not unfair. It never feels hard just for the sake of being hard. There’s always a way through — whether that’s learning to dodge, guard, or reflect properly. Every encounter teaches you something, and that’s the kind of difficulty I respect.\r\n\r\nCombat is where Khazan really shines. You get three main weapon styles, each with their own flavor. Every style has multiple skill branches that you can explore — or completely ignore — depending on how you want to play. It’s flexible and encourages experimentation. Whether you're into calculated strikes or chaotic brawling, the game supports it.\r\n\r\nIf you play it like a Dark Souls game — dodge, run in, poke, run out — you're going to get wrecked. Khazan rewards relentless aggression. You’re expected to stay close and keep the pressure on, even more so than Sekiro or Black Myth Wukong. It’s fast, intense, and honestly pretty addicting once it clicks. Go Berserk, ika-nga. \r\n\r\nLevel design is solid for a linear game. Nothing groundbreaking, but it serves the experience well. The lore is on the generic side, but still adds enough intrigue to keep you interested. Crafting and the weapon system are decent — there’s room for improvement, but it’s functional and satisfying for the most part.\r\n\r\nMy only real complaint is the inventory system. It’s messy, the sorting options are terrible, and it becomes a pain once you start collecting more items. Definitely needs a quality-of-life update.\r\n\r\nIf you're into Soulslikes and want something fresh that still respects the core of what makes the genre great, Khazan is absolutely worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1747145901, "timestamp_updated": 1747145901, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1747306391, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

Though nearly every boss is a \"skill check\" (some more than others), the challenge always felt fair, with the game offering many solutions/approaches to the same attacks. What Khazan perhaps lacks in terms of level design--where FromSoftware especially shines in comparison--it vastly makes up for in terms of gameplay, flexibility and overall QoL. Khazan is proof that QoL doesn't need to come at the expense of difficulty; the game is tough-as-nails, but you can ultimately make it as hard or as easy as you want it to be. I chose the former path and thoroughly enjoyed getting a beatdown with every boss attempt while methodically making my way through each level to get all the collectibles.

If so, buy this game. This is not a joke or an exaggeration. If you enjoyed Nioh 2 I can just about guarantee you will have fun with this title.\r\n\r\nIf you have not played Nioh 2 before, this game is a souls-like, but it would probably be more accurate to call it a boss rush with souls-like elements. The game is level-based rather than an inter-connected world, and there is plenty of exploration and loot to find. However, there are only three types of weapons, with the moveset of all weapons of the same type being exactly the same. IE: all spears have the same moveset, all greatswords have the same moveset, and all dual-wield sets have the same moveset.\r\n\r\nThe emphasis here is on the combat, and mastering your choice of individual weapons. And combat feels *good*. Really good. This game emphasizes aggressive play, and forcing openings in your opponents. After all, you are the first \"berserker\" Khazan. Nowhere is this more prevalent than when you reach the end of a level and find the boss. Every main boss in the game has a varied moveset that will punish you for sloppy play and/or passive play. These moveset are fun to learn, and even more fun to conquer. Especially the last few main bosses that really amp up the scale.\r\n\r\nThere is a massive emphasis on perfect blocking and perfect dodging to avoid damage while keeping on the offensive pressure, so a level of precision and reaction is required, not dissimilar to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice.\r\n\r\nThe story is promising, but unfortunately doesn't have enough buildup for most of its key moments. So it's not selling the game. However, the combat is so good, and the moment to moment gameplay so fun, I don't actually care that the story feels slightly underwhelming at points. If you like the sound of a boss rush game with fast-paced nioh style gameplay, there is nothing better than Khazan. \r\n\r\nIf any of that sounds remotely interesting to you, at least give the demo a shot.

There's always a respawn point outside their door, and you can pick up your lost lacrima without going into the arena, making losing it an almost deliberate action. Getting walled?

The game introduces a rich set of mechanics and actively encourages their use—perfect blocks, perfect dodges, reflections, and counterattacks all play a key role. Hitboxes feel precise and fair, making each encounter skill-based and rewarding.\n\nDrawbacks:\n- Environments become visually repetitive, particularly in the second half of the game.\n- Some bosses have excessive health, causing fights to drag on unnecessarily.\n- Weapon scaling feels underdeveloped and doesn’t significantly affect gameplay.\n- Stat, gear, and upgrade bonuses are too minor - bonuses like +0.5% damage or +2% HP regen from flasks feel almost meaningless.\n- More complex weapons like greatswords often deal the same damage as overly simple ones, like a spear that can be spammed with one button. It would be nice to reward players who take on greater challenges - for example, with achievements for completing the game without relying on overly easy weapon setups or more complex weapon should be more rewarding in terms of damage.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1746978159, "timestamp_updated": 1746978159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

However, I enjoyed exploring the world, that was the most enjoyable part.\n\nGameplay. Terrible character control. Completely ignores the controller when hitting, Kazan is slow, loses control, runs or dodges with a big delay, and if he is touched even a little, he immediately freezes and seems like he is about to cry\n\nBosses. The monster bosses are really good. The human bosses are a complete failure: they ignore backstabs, they turn around instantly, they can just take no hits at their will. The developers do not understand the concept of stamina in this genre at all. Sometimes bosses going in such rush that they don't allow not even to hit back, they don't even allow you to restore stamina, they're firing with abilities like from a machine gun, worst design ever. Hate this game. Also Bosses have absurd quantity of HP comparing to your DPS\n\nLeveling. The most boring show I've ever seen. It's more interesting to watch my flower grow in a pot than to develop Kazan with levels. I want you to get +0.004% to your salary increase every year. Understandable, no? If not, then let me explain, when I make a hit by 1500-8000, then the bonus from the level to damage of +6 is just a joke. When I get hit by 500, 800, and sometimes 1500, then the increase in HP by 10 is just an empty phrase. I don't feel my character grows. What's the point of leveling up if I was killed by a mob in 3 hits at lvl 1 and the same at the level 140? And by the way: I have found a spear with scaling B+ from spirit and it was the best spear in the whole game! This is ridiculous!\n\nPlot. An absolute failure. I don't care about the history of the enemies I've already killed. While I'm going to them, I have to collect information about the enemy so that I can draw his portrait.

They don't punish you for mistakes, they just punish you period. I don't appreciate when I have the skill to recover from an attack and instead I'm forced to watch myself stand around for a full second while the boss wails on me and resets the counter on when I can react. The majority of my deaths were me watching myself get mashed to a pulp when I could have responded.\n\nSecondly, every step in this game quickly became a slog of \"ambush mechanics\" every other attack was a feint or fake out. every corner has an enemy. every step I take there's some surprise around the corner. Or through a wall. Or in the floor. The game isn't built for managing multiple enemies at once yet I'm constantly thrown into group combat.\n\nInstead of charging around, berserking on things, I'm forced to tiptoe and slam my head against the wall.\n\nI'd love to recommend this game but instead of feeling empowered I feel exhausted.

It’s a tight, focused action RPG that knows exactly what it wants to be—and delivers it with confidence.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is simple to pick up but leaves plenty of room to master. From your first swing, the combat feels weighty and impactful.\r\n\r\nThe game immediately lets you try every weapon type, which I loved. It gave me a real chance to find a style that clicked—and it made early-game experimentation fun, not frustrating.\r\n\r\nExploration is heavily rewarded. The map is filled with secrets, upgrades, and collectibles that make your character stronger. You’re constantly encouraged to venture off the beaten path, and the game respects your time by making it worth it.\r\n\r\nBoss battles are the highlight. Each one is unique and challenging, with distinct mechanics and memorable designs. They’re tough, but never unfair—and beating them feels incredibly satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe art direction is striking. The environments, enemy designs, and overall atmosphere feel dark, gritty, and beautifully executed.\r\n\r\nThe campaign isn’t too long, but it doesn’t feel short either. I had nearly 90% of the collectibles before finishing the final boss, and I immediately wanted to dive into New Game+.\r\n\r\nThat said, a few things could be better:\r\n\r\nFast travel could use improvement. Currently, you have to return to the main hub to use the Blade Nexus, which breaks up the pacing a bit too often.\r\n\r\nThe main hub itself is a bit fragmented. Important vendors like the jar seller, nomad, your follower, and the blacksmith are all in different areas—requiring load screens just to hop between them. It’s a small thing, but it adds up over time.\r\n\r\nStill, those issues didn’t stop me from loving the game.\r\n\r\nCombat is crisp, progression feels meaningful, and the world pulls you in. Each time I downed a boss, I felt that real rush of accomplishment that only the best soulslikes deliver.\r\n\r\nIf you're a fan of action RPGs or challenging games in general, First Berserker: Khazan is absolutely worth your time.", "timestamp_created": 1746920279, "timestamp_updated": 1746920279, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Would definitely recommend if you’re chasing the next good action-heavy Souls-like.\n\n[b] What could be better: [/b] The story is passable and nothing to write home about.

A+ for team #2 for the effort in the graphics and the multiple paths allowed to be taken in the game and the variance in enemies. D- for team #3 for the cancer boss designs.\r\nFor as much as the game feels like they cared about the first 2 parts, the exact opposite feels true for the boss designs. The bosses are uninteresting, stupidly designed and feel like they are designed to just piss you off the entire time with badly designed combos/graphics and stupid high damage amounts. It also doesnt help that it feels like your hitting them with a pool noodle even when 50 levels over the \"Rec\" level. It wasnt even a \"memorize\" the pattern type of boss fights as the move sets sometimes make no sense in how the boss attacks. They are basically unstaggerable until you hit a \"Counter\", which may or may not ever come for you, so sometimes you just need to wail on the boss. Some fights I dont even know how I killed the boss as it was a shit show fight and they just kinda died to the summonable help NPC.  I understand this is a \"souls\" game and its \"HARD\" but this isnt hard, It's straight dumb and bad. Beating all the other DS's games and ERing on the hardest modes, these fights are lacking soooo much verse any of the other boss fights in those games. It feels like they are covering bad boss design with the \"souls\" tag. I do not advise this game, even after putting 80+ hours of frustration and grinding into it. 6.5/10 at best in consideration for the 1st and 2nd teams. It might just not be for me, but after talking with others as well, its not just me on these boss fights. You might be able to overlook it, or like the cancer, but Im out.

The end of the game makes me so close to not recommend it, but that'd be unfair because it's a good game overall.\n\nI think there is kind of a triangle when it comes to souls genre.\nDark Souls - Sekiro - Nioh\n\nThis game is towards the Nioh side. But, the combat is near identical to Lies of P, almost copy and paste but with Nioh type combos and flashiness. It's very buttery and well made. \n\nThis game is most similar to Nioh in the level design, but with Lies of P boss design. It also has the loot style of Nioh - shit loot everywhere. \n\nYou know how Dark Souls games usually reward exploration with really unique loot? Well this game rewards exploration heavily, it's everywhere, but, with mostly shit loot or crafting materials. I say shit loot but realistically it's useful consumables or crafting materials to them make into better gear, but it's doesn't feel good. It's quantity over quality. Almost every enemy drops some scraps, every corner has a piece of loot, and after a few hours, I just stopped looking at what I picked up because it was unimportant to me 95% of the time. You take all the loot, go through the mess and mark the ones you want to keep and then scrap or sell everything else.\n\nYou do however use this loot for what this game does well, which are the gear builds. There is a decent variety of builds you can make, you can slightly mix and match, but in my experience there were only 2 clear strong gear sets out of the 10-12 options I had for the weapon I chose. I used 1 set of gear for 95% of my playthrough.\n\nThe game left a really bad impression on me towards the end. Every level got longer and longer and longer, making the boss fights further apart. The levels are so uninteresting and while the mobs are well made, it gets old when you fight the same ones for 20+ hours and you just want to get to the next boss fight. Also, the levels are extremely easy. I probably died 50 times during the entire playthrough, and only maybe 5 of these deaths were not against boss fights.\n\nAnd then the last level and the final boss. Awful.\n\nThe last level was frustrating because I just basically conquered the game, Im making the final push to fight the final boss. But the level was just like any other bland level, except it had a long gotcha platforming section that is designed to prank you and kill you. I'm not saying it was difficult, but when I have only died like twice during a normal level, and then I die 3 times to pranks in a platforming section at the LAST level, it's like, why was THIS your finale? Why is THIS level my test of skill or my epic buildup to the final boss? It felt like the game wanted to create artificial difficulty.\n\nAnd then the final boss. Not hard, just not engaging, literally. He runs the entire fight and shoots projectiles at you. In a game ENTIRELY about parrying and combos, the final test of skill is an enemy that runs away and throws projectiles the entire time? The fight took me around 20-30 minutes because you spend the majority of the fight waiting for him to land on the ground so you can hit him. It was by far THE worst designed boss in the game.

Re-skin, reuse and repetition are the biggest and most evident issues of the game.\n\nThe story is mediocre, and the OST is not noticeable and, unfortunately, forgettable.\n\n[h3] The biggest issue is exploration. [/h3] \n\nThere are no zones or regions; it's just \"missions\", which are short levels with a hard start and a hard end with a boss, no matter what. There's nothing connecting missions with each other; just drop in, get to the end, kill the boss, repeat. On top of that, the level design and visuals were mediocre.\n\nOnce you complete a mission, you will likely get a side-mission or 2 or sometimes even 3 on that \"level\". But those optional missions are \"re-skined\" main missions, you get spawned at a \"sliced\" map of the original missions with the exact layout but some paths are blocked and monsters are of different type along (some adjustments to environment to fit the mobs and minor changes to environment, but the re-used parts are so evident it became obnoxious).\n\nThese \"isolated\" levels diminished the feeling of exploration to almost nothing, but it is itemization that made it a complete nothing.\n\nThere were some collectibles besides the \"estus flask\" updates that gave you minor power creep, but nothing special, just an item lying around; something to look out for.\n\n[h3] Reusing bosses and maps is the second biggest issue [/h3] \n\nAll of the optional bosses were just either downscaled main bosses, or exact same boss with a different skin, or just a mob with a larger HP pool. This made the optional missions just dogsh*t in my opinion. Before you even started, you already knew that you won't see anything new or cool on that level.\n\nSome side missions were different, but 95% of them followed the same formula and offered nothing but items, soulstones, and jins to make yourself stronger for main missions.\n\nWhat was nice was having a bonfire just before the boss, + dying left your \"souls\" at the entrance, and you even gave you extra \"souls\" for trying and failing the boss to giving you a chance to catch up with a recommended level. \n\n[h3] Itemization is the third biggest issue [/h3]\n\nHaving attributes and sets is nice., However, they matter too late into the game. \nOnce you've picked your set, the attributes and rarity were nice to fiddle with, but it doesn't come in until after 20h. In the early game, the attributes and levels barely matter. In my opinion it is a poor design to make a game system that is good for late game(+30h), but it fails to captivate anyone in early-mid game.\n\nIt is the Item Levels that made me not care about items after around 5h. Your inventory becomes a mess of random bullsh*t; same items but different levels. Picking items became a \"oh cool a \"helm of whateverthefuck\" lvl 10, whatever, I'll see it 20 more times\". \n\n[h3] Early game is actually okay [/h3]\n\nBefore you notice the above issues, the game is decent.\n\nCombat is \"arcady\" compared to typical souls-likes, but that's not bad, it was kind of fun. It's not that serious, so you mostly just do combos, dodges/guards/parries, and mess around with mobs and bosses. However, once you've unlocked all the skills (around 20h) there's nothing new to be done; you just do what works and deals the most damage on repeat, nothing changes at that point, especially with bosses.\n\nWhat was really good was the freedom to experiment. The attributes were easy to switch, and most importantly, the skills were free to respec at any point. This allowed to to spec into any of the weapons and set at any point and time, and doing so made the game fun for the first hours, until the other issues became more evident.", "timestamp_created": 1746721421, "timestamp_updated": 1746723796, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.585740387439727783", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1747042879, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

Every fight demands focus, and enemies hit hard without mercy. Boss battles are especially intense, pushing you to learn patterns and react with precision. It’s easily the HARDEST game I’ve ever played, and some encounters can really push your limits. At the same time, it may feel repetitive. Wave after wave of enemies sometimes dulls the impact.\r\n\r\nVisually, the game impresses with its stylized art direction. The shaded graphics blend beautifully with the bleak environments, bringing a unique look. The soundtrack hits hard, also the powerful scores that underscores the game’s heavier moments. (Features I liked best in this game)\r\n\r\nIt’s not without flaws- Some camera issues show up during tight encounters, and the game could’ve used more variation in it’s enemy design.

The free demo was great and had enough of the original game to have me sold on giving it a shot. So far while it feels very linear it is still satisfying to play. The enemies on \"normal\" mode aren't too tough but pose a bit of challenge. The main bosses and mini bosses don't have a lot of variety to their attack patterns but I'm only about 2 hours in so that will probably improve. The story so far isn't super fleshed out but I feel that these types of games do better when they focus on the action and game play.

Don't listen to these hard stuck early boss players. (Tip: if you're ever having trouble with bosses, just open your skill tree and see what will help you in that fight).\n* Changing abilities is available from the start and free to do. \n* Changing stats is also fairly easy. Eventually you can craft the item and the materials are obtained naturally. I can probably craft 1k of this item at this point. \n* The game has plenty of enemy variation. I don't know why people would say otherwise.... maybe the hard stuck players who've only seen a handful of different types. \n* Combat has a quick pace and brink guarding and dodging feel responsive. \n* Each of the three weapon types have their own unique set of challenges and styles. (No, great-sword is not the hardest weapon to play). I've played through the game 5 times. NG (dual-wield), NG+ (spear), NG++ (great-sword), NG (spear), NG (great-sword). I won't say what I feel is the hardest to conquer, b/c it doesn't matter, but I will say be careful of random content creators farming clicks. Some of those (ultimate/best) builds are pretty awful. \n* The game is easy to platinum, if you're into achievements. I just played through the game and I basically had all but one. The one was glitched and has since been fixed. All that to say, you still need to get good and kill some bosses to get the platinum. \n* Bug-fixes. Every new launch, especially now days, has bugs. This game had it's fair share, but nothing game breaking. The developers have been rolling out patches to fix various issues. \n* Demo. The only reason why I even considered this game was because it has a demo. Played the demo and decided became addicted before launch. Luckily it was only a couple days before launch. When Khazan released, I took a break from CS and just started hammering away at this game.  \n\nCons:\n* Only three weapon types. I suspect they'll introduce more, but that is the current state as of the time of this review. \n* The story. I'm not much of a story guy in video games. If you're looking for deep intricate story-telling... this isn't the game for you (at the moment). I suspect this game is like watching the first episode of an anime/tv show or the first chapter of a book. It's just setup for story-telling later, but this review is on the current state of the game at the time writing.\n* The gear upgrading system makes no sense. It makes more sense to just craft a new set of gear. It probably has something to do with leveling gear with good rolls on it. It may even been more efficient to just re-roll the higher level gear.  Either way... upgrading gear system needs help/ a rework.", "timestamp_created": 1746559704, "timestamp_updated": 1746559704, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1747043354, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

This holds the real build potential where you can craft your own playstyle. You can remove skills with no punishment which lets you make every point count. They only have 3 weapons. Many won’t like the smaller roster but like Bloodborne, lower quantity means higher quality. All 3 are fun, unique, and have an insane amount of depth. I did Spears on my first run and tried out Greatsword on the mean time which were both incredibly fun and distinct. Tough bossfights but fair, and if you died at the boss room your souls respawn outside the boss room like Lies of P and you gain souls from bosses even if you lose, which are easy. This also has a summon system similar to Lies of P. It’s an ai, no multiplayer, but there’s one outside every boss door and you can fight phantoms to level up yours. I didn’t use this system but it seems like a great way to make the game more manageable.\r\n\r\nIf you're a big anime fan like myself, you will love the story.

Maybe i could grid for XP and farm items to use summons for bosses but that doesnt feel like a solution, could always turn the game down to easy mode and maybe that is an option but it doesnt feel like the right one.\r\n\r\nThis really hurts to say but for me this game is one of the biggest let downs i have ever experienced in gaming. Hopefully they were continue to add balance patches and make the fights/bosses better but in its current form i do not recommend this game and saying that makes me feel sick to my stomach.   \r\n", "timestamp_created": 1746519602, "timestamp_updated": 1746519602, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.476190477609634399", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 1747042996, "developer_response": "Hello, this is Junho Lee from the Khazan development team.

Things I didn't like - this has a lack enemy variety (endgame mainly) and has reskin bosses that have slightly different movesets which were not fun to fight even though I had fought them already. The enemy placements were questionable, especially towards the halfway point and onward, there's parts where strong enemies are put in a small area with an archer at the back picking me off (for example) and the level design is on the weaker end, finally the story is very barebones, follows the classic revenge plot with minor plot twists. In terms of difficulty, it is fairly balanced, personally, i didn't struggle too hard although i struggled on 3 bosses; [spoiler]Viper, Maluca, Ozma[/spoiler] , there's a lot of things in your disposal which makes fighting them pretty forgiving. Also, you're telling me its possible to launch a game that is well optimized and almost bug free right out of the gate in the year 2025!? I ran the game on a 3060ti, high settings preset, and capped at 75 FPS which ran buttery smooth (1440p). There was the occasional stutters here and there but they weren't too bad, props to the devs for releasing a game that guarantees a smooth experience. I think this game is worth your time, there's even a demo (about 2 hours long) which instantly hooked me in.

It's really a shame because The First Berserker: Khazan's deflection mechanic is about as good as Sekiro's. That's truly saying something considering how a lot of other developers tried to do the same with their games, but didn't quite hit the mark. I tried Lies of P for about 6 hours on Xbox and stopped because deflection felt awful. I played through Stellar Blade and have one play through left to get 100%; it did deflection better than Lies of P, but there was still a bit of delay even with the equipment that improves on it. Khazan, however, managed to nail the kind of precision needed to have a deflection mechanic that worked well against fast combos.\n\n[h2]So, why don't I recommend it despite liking the core combat mechanic it's built around?[/h2]\nSomewhere along development, Neople forgot that they still needed to have a fun game in between boss fights. A lot of moment to moment gameplay fell flat.\n\n[h3]Level Design[/h3]\nLevel design was far too simple and uninspired. One of the favorite \"shortcut\" methods I noticed in the game was to make you fight a difficult or \"Elite\" enemy not long after a \"bonfire\" and after you defeat it, there's immediately a \"shortcut.\"\n\n[h3]Player Attack Feedback[/h3]\nHitting enemies with the greatsword doesn't have a satisfying feedback. For one, too many regular non \"elite\" enemies are able to shrug off greatsword swings. You have to charge up or combo into a second swing to get any kind of hit stun on your attacks. An extremely slow initial swing that doesn't have any oomph is terrible for such a heavy weapon. The sound weapons make when hitting bodies is so dull and underwhelming. It just doesn't feel good, but I'm a stubborn greatsword user so I stuck with it. I'm not sure if the other two weapon types are any better, but I'm too tired of this game to try them out.\nThe way combat plays out against regular enemies in Khazan feels too much like Neople didn't want the player to ever feel strong.\n\n[h3]Intrusive Particle Effect Lighting[/h3]\nA lot of special attacks the player can do often creates these red slashing particles behind the weapon and I found myself having difficulty seeing smaller enemies at point blank range because of them. Part of that, though, is probably because of Khazan's body also obstructing player view and smaller enemies don't have enough visual indicators to compensate for the perspective and the effects flashing. A good example of this is Elamein. She has a few attacks that were difficult to follow when Khazan is at point-blank range. It's funny because it's this exact reason why FromSoftware protagonists are often manlets. Larger enemies are easier to see; go figure.\n\n[h3]Uninteresting Plot and Characters[/h3]\nIt's pretty self explanatory. I wouldn't complain about it if the non-boss fight gameplay was more satisfying, but it isn't. So, I try to find entertainment elsewhere. It's not in the story, characters, or dialogue, that's for sure.\n\n[h3]Minor Complaint[/h3]\nBoss Attack Animations\nAdditionally, bosses often have the weird delayed swings people complained about in Elden Ring. This one is more of a minor nitpick since, despite the annoying attack delays, I was able to buckle down and learn the fights I did well enough to the point that the tries where I do beat them almost seem like a perfectionist run. Though, I still bring it up because I wish developers wouldn't follow FromSoft on this kind of attack animations; I found them ugly in Elden Ring and I find them ugly in any other game that does them. Even for a video game, the movements look far too unnatural. Learning boss fights in Sekiro felt like a dance while learning them in Khazan felt like being offered a high five and getting kicked in between the legs instead.\n\nThe First Berserker: Khazan is really not a bad game. The deflections are smooth and precisely tuned.

I've done 2 full playthroughs and I still don't have enough. \n\nThe gameplay is smooth with dynamic combat and fun level design. I liked how the levels become increasingly longer and more difficult to traverse, adding some environmental challenges. At the same time, the player continuously gets better and obtains new tools, so there is never a roadblock - just a fun and unobtrusive challenge. Same with the bosses. You learn with each enemy type, each level, each boss, so when you do something for the 2nd time (you can repeat almost everything and sometimes fight \"stronger\" boss replicas), you see how much you've improved.\n\nI also enjoyed how the equipment system works. It constantly gives you better drops from mobs and exploration, but you can also augment and adjust your current items if you have something you particularly like. This means that you can be excited about obtaining new stuff, making the exploration and combat worthwhile.\nThere are also SO many different sets of armor, each doing its own thing. This is one of the things I liked the most, how your moveset can change based on what you've equipped. You can unlock special moves with different armor/weapon/jewelry, boosting some playstyle over another. I've been having a blast running through each level with a different set and therefore a different playstyle.\nYou are also free to respec and change your weapon type at any point of the game. So, you are free to explore combat to your heart's content.\n\nThe story is alright, nothing too original, but it does its job well enough and the characters are easy to like. The illustrations for some of the cutscenes are gorgeous, though. And the stylized visuals are certainly the way to go!\n\nKudos for sound design and the \"weight\" to the animations, too, especially the brutal finishers - pulling a massive hammer out of thin air to grind enemies to dust was weirdly satisfying.\n\nMy only complaint is - a small SPOILER - how you can screw yourself with the true ending. From my understanding, the true ending requires you to almost 100% complete the game, find all important collectibles, do all side quests, obtain special plot tools, and then you can beat the final boss in his strongest form. BUT if you... pick the \"wrong\" dialogue option in one random conversation, which doesn't hint at anything, you get almost the same ending, but... no achievement. And to rub salt in the wound,  you are given 3 dialogue choices, where one=revenge, two other ones =no revenge. Both of these mean that revenge is no longer your main objective, but SPOILER apparently \"want the truth\" is good, and \"want to talk\" is bad. You get the same ending, the same final battle, but no achievement. It's... weird? Tbh, I felt cheated, since you need to do another 100% new playthrough to obtain the trophy otherwise - and this conversation choice is such a random thing to determine it...\nI did enjoy the 2nd playthrough to finally get it, though, and I'm currently enjoying the 3rd one. But, yeah, you know. Still a puzzling requirement.\n\nEither way, great game!

The game has multiple endings, yet none of them left an emotional mark. Traversing the gorgeously hand painted levels is a joy, but the vengeance arc lacks weight, making the long playthrough feel unevenly rewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\nProgression & Replay\r\nProgression is entirely linear. You unlock up to Epic gear in the first run, with Epic gear being abundant at the end of the game. In NG+ you start to encounter Legendary gear toward the end, and in NG++ Legendary gear becomes more attainable. NG+ also opens up powerful new skill tree branches especially status effect mitigation that make later runs feel noticeably smoother (I only died four times in my second clear). However, the demo weapon you get early on has intentionally superior B+ scaling, and no main game loot ever matches it, granting a built in advantage that few weapons can rival.\r\n\r\n\r\nDifficulty & Player Agency:\r\nKhazan teaches you every mechanic up front perfect blocks, parries, dodges, consumables and then forces you to use them in lockstep. Even flawless guards build status effects (poison, burn, shock), so you can’t turtle your way through. You must dodge some telegraphed strikes, drain status with NG+ skills, and lean on every tool in your arsenal. Veteran Souls players will appreciate the fair but punishing curve deaths feel earned but if you love minimalist or unconventional builds, expect to be punished hard even in NG+.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrafting & Customization\r\nYou can craft many unique, stylish armour/weapon/accessory sets, level up equipment by sacrificing higher level fodder, and craft status resistance armour sets, but the loops can grow grindy. Transmog is locked until NG+, which is a needless cosmetic gate. Once you hit the end game, crafting feels like busywork rather than a fun optimisation puzzle.\r\n\r\n\r\nVisuals, Audio & Tech\r\nHand painted, manga inspired arenas and fluid, expressive animations make every fight legible and dramatic. The orchestral score swells perfectly for gauntlets, while crunchy FX on successful parries deliver visceral feedback. I did not encounter any lag or performance issues during my playthroughs.\r\n\r\nThe First Berserker Khazan Pros & Cons:\r\nPros\r\n* 37 memorable boss encounters\r\n* Precise, weighty combat and parry system\r\n* Strong art direction and technically solid performance\r\n\r\nCons\r\n* Bare-bones narrative and forgettable lore\r\n* Linear, unvarying progression\r\n* Rigid build requirements punish unconventional play styles\r\n\r\nSins\r\n* Demo weapon imbalance: Early demo gear sports B+ scaling that no main-game drop can match, unbalancing progression by design.\r\n* Cosmetics locked behind NG+: Transmog remain unavailable until New Game+, frustrating players who want to customize from the outset.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBottom Line\r\nIf you’re craving a fresh souls like game with relentless boss gauntlets, Khazan delivers in spades.

It's a really odd scenario for me where the game started off REALLY well but the farther into the game I get, the more I see this game to fall into the \"prepare to die\" meme where bosses and enemy placement are purely designed to kill you at all costs.\r\n\r\n***TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM***\r\n\r\nHowever, let's get into the review. For reference:\r\nLinux Mint 21.3 Cinnamon\r\n7900XTX\r\n64GB Ram\r\n13th Gen i9\r\nProton GE 9-25\r\n\r\n\r\n### Audio\r\n\r\nI played the game half in Chinese dubs and half in Japanese dubs. I have no problems with either. Likewise, this game is HEAVY. What I mean is, when I swing my giant slab of a weapon and hit an enemy, it's very audible. When the giant goat demon smacks me with a pickup truck he calls a weapon, I FEEL that shit. I love how heavy and weighty things are in this game.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the ambiance and atmosphere are spot on. I have no complaints about the audio in Khazan.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Graphics\r\n\r\nKhazan has its own artstyle and it's pretty nice. Khazan, the protag, is very visually distinguished in just about every way. Other characters are cleanly defined and the artstyle shines through. Enemies are also cleanly defined.\r\n\r\nI did not notice any texture warping, bending, graphical bugs, etc. I have no complaints about the graphics in Khazan.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Linux Performance\r\n\r\nThe game basically ran right out of the box. I originally started on Proton Experimental (bleeding edge) but later had some problems after an update. Switching to GE 9-25 solved the problems. Aside from that, it was a smooth 60fps (capped) experience the entire time. Wish more games were this effortless.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Gameplay\r\n\r\nSo this is a soulslike with Diablo style loot, sorta like Nioh but not that autistic. You have a light attack and a heavy attack. You can block, parry, and dodge. This game does have a stamina bar which I'm not too fond of anymore but it's not a bad thing. I'm not going to get too deep into this because it plays just like most other soulslikes.\r\n\r\nAs for loot, it can drop in various rarities with various affixes on them. It seems most equipment, aside from accessories, belong to a set. Set bonuses can be a pretty big deal. For example, draining an enemy's \"stamina\" puts them into a stagger state where you can wail on them for a bit and also execute what's effectively a visceral attack. Viscerals come in two flavors whether it'll kill the enemy or just damage them. I must say, the killing viscerals are brutal and I love it. One of the earlier sets offers a skill that, once per stagger, will reset the stagger window and give you even more unobstructed damage. Love it.\r\n\r\nAside from that, this game also features aerial AoE takedowns. Similar to something like Ronin, if you're elevated above an unaware enemy, you can do an aerial visceral that also has a small AoE impact to it. This is, as you might imagine, also very brutal and I love it. Khazan is a brutal guy and the game conveys that well.\r\n\r\nLastly, similar to Nioh, you can dismantle gear you don't want and craft gear you do want. To craft gear, you need the blueprint for it which is often found around the levels. I didn't feel that these were very hidden but I'm also the kind of person who tries to explore everything so YMMV.\r\n\r\n\r\n### My Gripes\r\n\r\n## Enemy Placement\r\n\r\nI'm a big fan of Dark Souls 2. I feel like it's the only game in the trilogy, with the exception of the first, that tried to be a sequel. However, Dark Souls 2 is often criticized for a lot of things like \"the spambush\" and \"peppering you with archers\".\r\nWhy do I bring this up? Khazan does both of these in the most egregious manner. Almost every enemy encounter that isn't a solo experience is riddled with archers. So you either dodge arrows you don't even see coming while dealing with the melees or sprint past them to take out the 3+ archers scattered around the arena. \r\nKhazan also has an egregious amount of spambushes. I mean, it's *sorta* fine because I used a greatsword and it has very wide swing arcs but I can't imagine how it'd be for a spear main. Still, the cancer of archers and the prominence of spambushes makes me feel like this game just wants me dead at all costs and I find that to be a bad thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Boss HP, Movesets, and Phases\r\n\r\nThis is a really weird topic for me because I feel like boss design got progressively worse as the game went on. The dragonkin boss in the snowy area? Absolute cinema. Vergil knockoff? Absolute cancer.\r\n\r\nThere some weird quirks in these boss fights. It feels like every damn boss, with the exception of a small handful, have some kind of ailment associated with them. I get it - goat demon has a fire nail and it'll burn me if it touches me. But... why do I still get flame buildup WHEN BLOCKING? Is my greatsword alive and an extension of myself? My weapon is pretty stamina heavy and I did not skip out on investing in stamina and HP alongside my damage stat but... it's just a lot of damage. To make matters worse, at that point in the game, there is no shop to buy ailment recovery items or a way to make them. So, if you run out, you're screwed.\r\n\r\nLikewise, later bosses just have... way too much HP. Combine that with the multiple phases that damn near every boss has and it just feels like a slog. I just crafted, what I can assume to be, the highest iLvl weapon I possibly could and it feels like I'm tickling bosses unless I'm hitting them with a fully charged heavy attacks. In addition to the bloated HP and multiple phases, these bosses do shitloads of damage with Elden Ring-tier attack chains. Again, it feels like the game wants me dead at all costs.\r\n\r\nLastly, movesets are all over the place. I had a hard time when I got to the first real boss - the dragonkin guy in the snowy area. However, learning his moveset felt rewarding to finally beat him. Vergil knockoff later in the game? I couldn't give a shit less. I felt like I just got done smacking myself in the nuts when the fight was over. I was elated. Not because I surmounted a challenge but because I don't have to deal with that shit anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What I DID Like\r\n\r\n## Equipment Crafting\r\n\r\nNo one wants to farm Lothric Knights for 2 hours until the one item you want drops. However, this doesn't work in the classic Souls experience since there are no affixes or rarity.\r\n\r\n## The Weight of Gameplay\r\n\r\nI like how heavy, brutal, and visceral Khazan is. Khazan is a berserker, usually identified with sheer, overwhelming force. I FEEL that when I do a visceral or even swing my sword. I REALLY like how they nailed this aspect and this is probably the one game I'll think about when I think of a Greatsword done right. I loved watching mooks smack me with twigs while I poise through it, charging my delete key.\r\n\r\n## Aesthetics\r\n\r\nThe armor/weapon designs in this game are pretty fucking cool. The Soul Eater set is my favorite and I appreciate the way Khazan takes his helmet off for cutscenes. He's a goddamn berserker, he doesn't need a bitch-mask.\r\n\r\n## Mission Checkpoints\r\n\r\nOne of the things that made farming Nioh levels a chore is having to run from the start to the actual point you want to get to. Wo Long does that shit too. Khazan? Checkpoints are unlocked as you find them and you can freely travel from the hub to any unlocked checkpoint. FUCKING. BRILLIANT. Team Ninja - take notes.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Overall Thoughts/tl;dr\r\n\r\nI played the demo and it seemed pretty neat. Bought the full game and fell in love as soon as I picked up the greatsword. Game started off really, really well and just seemed to nosedive from there. Bloated boss HP, cancer 15-swing combos, all the goddamn archers and spambushes all over the place really ruined the experience. I haven't even finished this game but I don't think I even have the willpower to.\r\n\r\nMaybe this game, like Sekiro, just \"isn't for me\" and that's fine. However, I've experienced what I see are problems and I'm not going to just overlook those.", "timestamp_created": 1746294568, "timestamp_updated": 1746294568, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.493589729070663452", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

"last_played": 1746042694}, "language": "english", "review": "[h3]A little bit mixed on this [/h3]\nI would feel bad giving this a thumbs down, but i'd also be lying if i said i had an amazing time playing it.\n\nI want to do alot of prefaceing, by saying that overall i think that this, as a soulslike, feels great to play and has a healthy amount of different enemies and unique bosses!\nIt's simplistic with the things you can skill when leveling, laying it clear what stats to skill depending on your weapon, the variety of comsumables and items is also fairly small and doesn't distract you from your gameplay.\nIt also has interesting skilltrees that give you abilities that feel great, and also a great variety of armor sets that can give you some neat extra abilities.\nI enjoyed trying out the 3 different weapons with their respective skill trees and some of the abilities you can get.\nThe story is pretty linear and doesn't have alot of twists and turns, but is made enjoyable to watch with the cutscenes.\n\n[h3] Comparing to other games [/h3]\nIf i had to compare it to other games, i'd compare it to Sekiro with how it the attack rythm of bosses (and some enemies) feel like they're ment to be brink guarded in a certain rythm, and with the skill trees of the different weapons and how the counterable red attacks work.\nMy other comparison would be Nioh, because of the linear level design, the quest structure, sidequest being repeats of previous zones and bosses (or elite enemies), and they even made the storytelling structure very similar to Nioh, where you frequently get little story cutscenes at the end of levels.\nThe fact that you have armor sets is also very akin to Nioh, also \"Phantom mode\" being basically Niohs \"Living Weapon\"/\"Yokai Shift\" form, and even most of the keybinds being the same Nioh uses, but most annoyingly it has collectables that are just as, if not more annoying than in Nioh.\n\nGranted, Khazan does some things better than Nioh, like less trash equipment bloating your inventory, and sets being a whole lot less annoying to craft, because you don't have to grind bosses for the smithing text or the item itself to randomly drop in Nioh.\nInstead you can just beat old bosses rather quickly to get the material, or even buy a limited number of them, to craft them, at your current level.\nAnd the materials even specify from which levels boss they drop, if you even need boss materials to craft that set.\nYou can find most recipes by exploring, which i believe can potentially be easy to miss, if you don't take the time to explore levels, while some recipes are \"hidden\" behind rewards from killing some of the special enemies in a certain way (which in itself i think is also a cool reward system).\n\n[h3]What it does badly[/h3]\nIn my opinion the collectables, aka Soulstones and Jarlings (and Khazans Memories*), are jarring.\nEspecially because Jarlings are tied to player power, by allowing you to buy head pieces that give extra stats while not taking up set slots, and Soulstones making your healing stronger (cause i didn't care for the Lacrima) and increasing your max spirit.\nThere were also some grievances that i had with backtracking explained further down.\n\n*\n(I don't have too much of an opinion on the Khazan Memories, because i always managed to find them without going back, but i could see people being annoyed by having to backtrack for them too, since they were also sometimes hidden behind breakable/illusary walls, and also tied to player power.)\n\n[h3]How collectables affect exploration[/h3]\nI felt the need to have a guide open at all times when going through levels, because missing them was extremely annoying, since once i beat the boss, i had to run through portions of the level again.\nAnd sometimes running through the level got very Jarring, because on my way there i had to kill pretty much all the enemies, because of how far they would chase me, unlock elevators again (which are also made so you can't access them during combat, so they actively discourage from speeding through levels again), find the one hidden illusary/breakable wall that i missed, just to get to where i needed to go.\nJust seeing levels with 5 Soulstones and a Jarling (i was about to write Kodama, cause they are basically the same thing), made me groan in my head, because i knew i had to go through the level more carefully, to not miss these random walls again.\n\nI have nothing against backtracking, but it's annoying when you have places you can't backtrack to, or when its unnecessarily tedious.\nThere are very few instances of that happening, but it was annoying whenever it did happen.\nOne example i have is in \"First Act of Revenge\" where i chose the last Blade Nexus to teleport to, after having already finished the level.\nI was blocked from backtracking downhill, because of a boulder, that is supposed to roll down, as you normally enter the area from other side, allowing you to go uphill.\nBut because he boulder \"reset\" and neither you nor the enemies could kick it down, i was basically \"locked\" in the later portion of the level.\nAnother example is in the same level, where it has nothing to do with the level resetting, but after you go past the boar and jump down, you can't get back up.\nAnd then, even if you reach the next Blade Nexus, you first have to teleport back to The Crevice, rather than being able to just teleport to an earlier Blade Nexus, from another Blade Nexus.\nEvery time you have to teleport back to The Crevice, making you sit through an extra loading screen, and then you go back and select the Blade Nexus you want.\n\nI was more excited to play through the side missions, simply because they were shorter and usually easy to backtrack, and because they only had 0-2 Soulstones, so even if i missed one, i can run back quickly and search for it.\nI felt the same way about Nioh and the Kodama, but at some point i felt they're not very impactful, so while it was annoying to not have collected all in a level, i just kept going and never repeated these 5-8 Kodama levels again (plus Nioh levels don't let you teleport to any checkpoints, only the start of the level.\nHonestly, i believe if these things were implemented differently, exploration and backtracking would feel alot better.\n\nI loved how some Soulstones were hidden in the environment for example,where i just had to chuck a spear at them.\nThat also made me look around more and into the distance, and appreciate the environmental design, but the \"hidden\" ones, in some close quarter areas, are just so easy to miss, and they made me feel like i have to look at every wall.\nAnd yes, at some point i realized that the Jarling jars always have a little \"effect\" on them, so they can be spotted more easily, but these collectables just made me feel like i had to pay attention to every single jar, the ground, and every wall. Constantly.\nTo me, that does not feel great, and it soured my experience, of how i felt i had to traverse the levels, to not re-explore these levels, rather than actually \"exploring\" levels more freely.\n\n[h3]Another tiny negative [/h3]\nOne other small gripe i had was 2-3 specific bosses spending alot of time out of your reach very frequently. [spoiler] Princess Ilyna, Reese and especially Ozma [/spoiler]\nWhile on 2 of them it felt alright most of the time and not as drawn out, it felt really annoying on 3rd one mentioned in spoilers, especially with the amount of attacks that boss inflicts status on you with and the amount of phases the boss has, making it an extremely drawn out fight.\n\n[h3]Closing thoughts[/h3]\nIf the devs were to reduce the tediousness of backtracking and if they made breakable/illusary walls a little more prominent if they wanna have that many of them in their game, then i'd be a bit more excited if they were to announce a DLC or a sequel.\nBut as of now, all i can say is that i enjoyed it a bit more than my recent playthrough of Nioh 2, but i believe that's mainly due to Khazan being a shorter game with less side missions overall, making it less bloating", "timestamp_created": 1746271492, "timestamp_updated": 1746315365, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608119845390319824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

While Khazan is technically a \"souls-like\" game, it's closer, spiritually, to Nioh, which is known more for it's mission select level design rather than being a more open world style. I would say that Nioh, and by extension Khazan, is very different from a classic Souls game, and I would keep that in mind if you're looking to try Khazan out. If you didn't really enjoy Nioh much, Khazan does share a lot with it. However if you, like me, enjoyed Nioh, then you will LOVE Khazan.\n\nAs an added bonus, if you're a fan of DFO, or even if you've played DNF Duel, you'll most likely find Khazan interesting in some way from a lore perspective. It was exciting seeing certain characters from DFO, a sprite game, come to life in a big 3D action RPG, and finding references to DFO in Khazan's world design was extremely fun for me as a long-time fan.\n\nThe main allure to Khazan is it's combat. The combat feels fluid, responsive, visceral, and hefty. All three weapon types have distinct playstyles, but each feels exceptionally rewarding to learn and master. Leveling up and gaining new skills feels exciting and rewarding, plus being able to freely switch which weapon skills you want to use encourages the player to experiment and try new things when met with resistance. I found myself using all three weapons throughout my first playthrough. Additionally, being able to dodge, block, and parry enemies felt extremely satisfying, since you're encouraged to use every defensive option in your arsenal. If dodging doesn't work out, try blocking. If blocking doesn't work, try dodging. The game of trial, error, failure, success, and ultimate triumph is exemplified in Khazan's combat variety.\n\nBoss difficulty would bounce between \"fair\" and \"cheap\" depending on the boss, but by the end of the game I definitely had fun fighting most of the game's boss offerings. However, none of the bosses felt particularly simple, and each of them had interesting quirks that kept me on my toes. Personally, I'd rather a boss have a cheap gimmick than fall over without a fight. Bosses feature a lot of HP, which ensures that you spend a good amount of time fighting each one. I never felt like a boss fight ended too soon or was too easy, but I did find that certain boss fights dragged on a touch too long sometimes.\n\nI think if I had to pick a bad point about Khazan, it's level design and visuals. The game's visuals are good, but the environments lack contrast, especially early on. It feels like there's a constant haze in front your eyes that makes the world look dull. While I do understand that it works from an emotional standpoint, Khazan's point of view is bleak and it's meant to look dreary, from a gameplay standpoint it makes levels look a bit uninteresting to look at. On top of that, certain enemy encounters drain almost all color from the screen, sending you into a nearly greyscale world.\n\nEnemy placement felt oddly predictable, I didn't really feel challenged by the normal enemies very often. I could generally understand what kind of encounters I would face based on the appearance of the level. Getting ambushed around a corner or being shot at by archers on a bridge, seeing a broken piece of dock by the water with a conveniently placed item next to it. A lot of these types of scenarios are ones I've seen done previously in other games, and didn't feel very original. Despite that, it's not a huge deal to me, especially in a game like this where boss fights are the big focus, I can forgive a slightly boring level layout.\n\nAll in all, Khazan is a satisfying game that I will certainly play more of even after beating it once.

Khazan is a good little soulslite that really excels in combat and boss fights while being largely lackluster everywhere else. Nioh meets Sekiro, but not quite as good as either. It's not as fast or as complex as Nioh. It doesn't quite have the great level design or enemy variety of Sekiro either. Khazan doesn't necessarily do anything new. It's familiar territory, but given how often developers screw up the basics, it's nice to see a title that executes it well for the most part. That said, the game features many of the same weaknesses as Nioh. Terrible camera, repetitive linear levels with samey enemies, optional bosses being literal copies of main bosses, a completely forgettable plot, and boring random loot. The art style is decent. The armor designs look really cool and bosses are an impressive spectacle. I like the cel shading used here. Environments are a little less inspired. A lot of brown and gray caves and dungeons that got so damn old to navigate. Bosses are a huge highlight but Lord have mercy do they take forever to die. You basically die in like 3-4 hits, but they need a Killer Instinct Ultra combo just to get staggered. Nioh was like this as well, but combat was much faster and thanks to the Ki Pulse mechanic you could unleash combos without ever needing to wait for stamina to regen. Waiting for stamina to regen is so common in boss fights here. It just kills momentum. This game also has a hyperdemon mode like Nioh except it's pure trash. Slow weak attacks and a low duration. Why would I waste a dozen skill points on a spirit mode that can't even do as much damage as Khazan in his normal form? Build variety is quite light given the small shallow skill trees and only three weapon types. Several stats just become dump stats once you find a weapon you like, so progression becomes boring. Not really much of an RPG. I enjoyed my time with Khazan, but I got bored of the overlong bland levels and really just wanted to get to the next boss fight ASAP. I didn't enjoy any of the side missions which are mostly just the same bosses you fought previously. Good, but unexceptional. Should hold you over 'til Nioh 3 descends from the heavens.

What I found really cool, is that the game forces you to understand every boss pattern before you can kill it, which means if you will leave boss at 10% hp, lose your mind and all in, you will find yourself next to a last bonfire.
