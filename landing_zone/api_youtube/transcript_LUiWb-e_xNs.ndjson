{"text": "like the spot like you see the door that", "start": 176.8, "duration": 3.92}
{"text": "you feel like that you can enter, but", "start": 179.28, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "it's actually locked. And it's locked", "start": 180.72, "duration": 4.159}

{"text": "this shadow realm if you want to call it", "start": 191.68, "duration": 5.279}
{"text": "and then go and just find the core by", "start": 193.92, "duration": 5.039}

{"text": "flash and then you will just remove it", "start": 198.959, "duration": 3.761}
{"text": "and yeah that's an interesting mechanic", "start": 201.2, "duration": 2.72}
{"text": "and that's probably the biggest", "start": 202.72, "duration": 2.96}
{"text": "differentiating factor of this game to", "start": 203.92, "duration": 3.28}
{"text": "any other soul likes and not going to", "start": 205.68, "duration": 4.08}

{"text": "recently played the Elder Ring and got", "start": 224.959, "duration": 4.161}
{"text": "quite far in it again. So maybe that's", "start": 226.799, "duration": 4.08}
{"text": "the reason, but still it feels a bit", "start": 229.12, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "easier to play than other Soul Life. So", "start": 230.879, "duration": 3.681}

{"text": "game, UI kind of sucked. Now it's very", "start": 246.239, "duration": 4.321}
{"text": "easy. Everything has the button on it", "start": 248.48, "duration": 3.679}

{"text": "going to do it. Combat again also have", "start": 270.4, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "been remapped and it's it feels a bit", "start": 272.32, "duration": 4.159}
{"text": "more fluid but not as good to be fair.", "start": 274.24, "duration": 5.28}
{"text": "Not as impactful as in games like Elder", "start": 276.479, "duration": 5.28}

{"text": "still need to run and jump in most of", "start": 293.84, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "the places. game is still made for the", "start": 295.44, "duration": 4.16}

{"text": "you will share the progression together", "start": 321.919, "duration": 4.56}

{"text": "the best part of this and probably the", "start": 359.759, "duration": 4.72}
{"text": "biggest and best gameplay decision and", "start": 362.16, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "marketing decision that this game has", "start": 364.479, "duration": 4.081}

{"text": "this. It takes two developers and I", "start": 375.36, "duration": 3.04}
{"text": "think they did the same thing with the", "start": 377.28, "duration": 2.4}
