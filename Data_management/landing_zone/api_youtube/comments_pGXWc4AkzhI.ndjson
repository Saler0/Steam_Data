However, some points you made rub me the wrong way and ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth at the end of the video.\n\n(4:13 - 5:10) Dark Souls 2 takes a different approach to DS1 where it does everything in its power to prevent you from simply running past enemies. This was to punish DS1 veterans who would simply run past all the enemies and to encourage a slower approach to the game (and you don't need to have played DS1 to recognize the game wants you to take things slow and to clear every enemy). It's really weird then for you to run past all of the enemies in Heide's Tower of Flame with... fists only? while in NG+ and understanding there would be even MORE enemies, and then complain about enemies ganking you. And complaining about how far they followed you. That is what you get for not respecting the enemies of this game! If you made it all the way to NG+, you should've learned that lesson by then. You should've been taking out those enemies instead of letting them pile up on you, and if you chose to run past because of your fist-only run, that's an issue with fists-only and you should not have used that as an example of ganky enemies. It feels like I'm watching one of those poorly made critiques of DS2.\n\nAlso I'm not sure why you say this is an issue with SotFS, the mindset was in base DS2 as well (and SotFS removed a lot of the ambushes that was in the base game and shrunk down the amount of enemies in a lot of areas). I never felt encouraged to run past enemies except for one instance in Shrine of Amana when playing SotFS for the first time last year, and even when replaying the game multiple times, I still don't run past everything; and a friend of mine who played DS2 for the first time was playing SotFS and they didn't do that either (or at least, if they did, they quickly learned their lesson), so I don't know why you're attributing your poor gameplay to SotFS.\n\n(6:05 - 6:21) That's just... not true about The Pursuer lol. The curse stab doesn't let him use dark magic attacks against you (and while I haven't gotten stabbed by that in SotFS, I did a couple of times in vanilla, so if you have footage of that happening when you first fight the Pursuer in the Forest of Fallen Giants, you should've shown that instead). He gains new dark magic attacks based on the area he's in. I have faced that dark magic attack many times without getting stabbed by the curse stab. In some other areas, he gains an expanded sword moveset, or can shoot magic waves at you with his sword that deal physical damage.\n\n(9:15 - 9:51) This is more subjective but I personally feel like Dark Souls 2 is the best story out of all three games, and even to a younger version of myself who didn't read too much about the lore and didn't look into the themes of the game, the plot was more engaging than DS3 (Dark Souls 1 was the last Souls game I played, after Elden Ring, so I didn't have an opinion on that game). The game expanding on the Undead Curse from Dark Souls 1 that wasn't explored properly enough, what it means to be Undead and to have your memories and sense of self slowly hollow away till you become a shell of your former self, is extremely engaging. Unlike Dark Souls 1 and 3 which focuses on larger than life figures who are way past their prime and where many of the major events of the game happen long before you come along, you instead focus on one man - King Vendrick - and everyone surrounding him and his rule. The war of Drangleic and the giants, his attempts to rid Drangleic of the Undead, his attempts - and failure - to cure the Undead Curse, and him retreating into the deepest parts of the kingdom, both to hide from his wife, Nashandra, and to hide in shame and regret. More focus is given on the other NPCs as well and how they each manage the Undead Curse, how it slowly whittles away at their minds. And if you're keen enough, Vendrick's brother Aldia and the sheer amount of effort he put into finding a cure for the Undead Curse. It all feels so much more personal, especially because you both have a narrative reason and a gameplay reason to want to get rid of hollowing and the Curse (due to your health shrinking from dying), and because of how it's eroding away at almost everyone you meet.\n\nEven if you aren't a fan of that or find DS1 or 3 more appealing, I wouldn't at all call it weak, and it expands on DS1's story and world in a much better way than DS3 did, which just tiredly rehashes the same old ideas and concepts and even some of the figures, and while it tries to make that the point, is too blinded by nostalgia to stick the landing. DS2 just has different priorities in storytelling than DS1, and certainly DS3.\n\n(11:50 - 12:08) I won't go into detail here since it's been mentioned a lot, but the Throne of Want represents the decision to link the First Flame or usher in an Age of Dark, whereas abandoning the throne with Aldia means rejecting the choice and choosing to find a cure for the Undead Curse instead. It's why Vendrick was able to make that choice and is characterized by being afraid of making that choice, it's why Nashandra was urging him to let the First Flame die, and it is why she fights you for the throne at the end instead now that Vendrick and his guards are gone, so she can make that choice herself.\n\n(15:13 - 15:31) Yeah, the animations are slow... that's the point? It's around the same in Dark Souls 1 as well. I've never noticed a difference in how the animation speed feels (hard to compare animations between the two because they are in different engines and don't share any weapon animations) when going from DS1 to 2 or vice versa. They are slower-paced than Bloodborne, DS3 (which became faster after Bloodborne), and Elden Ring, but even then, the point has always been that the animations are slow and deliberate. Maybe that's a negative for you, and that's okay, but it is not exclusive to DS2, it's in DS1 as well (and I specifically enjoy the slower, \"turn-based\" nature of those two games) and I'm sure it's in Demon's Souls as well.\n\nAlso, unrelated to any point, but I think it would've been really nice if you did different builds that weren't just... the rapier and the Tseldora set, or fists only. Like you didn't have to do anything crazy, honestly you could've just used a longsword or something basic, but rapier + Tseldora set just feels like something other people who shit on DS2 use a lot and it gives weird vibes to me as this is a video that's supposed to be praising DS2. Especially because build variety is so good in DS2, it would've been great to see you explore that.\n\n*****\n\nSorry for all of the complaints and nitpicks! I love this game a lot and while normally I wouldn't spend so much time on something like this, they started adding up for me to the point where I wasn't enjoying the video and I didn't see much people bringing up these points. I do really appreciate you trying to change people's minds about DS2 and encouraging them to try it out, I just feel the execution wasn't completely there.

In either cases, the curse still persists, and the cycle will continue when a new undead challenges you for the throne.\nAldia offers you a third option, to ignore the first flame altogether, and search for a way to break the curse and exist outside of the cycle.

Not exactly like ink ribbon from RE, but close enouth to force you to sweat like a pig, after you make a 1.5h progress into deadly unknown. \nDemon Souls was pure survival horror mechanicaly.  There was no estus, you NEED resourses and you NEED to  preserve them. Sure you can farm, but noobs never know how, where, and probably want to leave most of areas behind coz it was hard. So, from my expierience it was constant balance of your items to progress. \nDark Souls was much more \"action oriented\" but it was such a brilliant interconnected world with so many dangers, i nbever feel like estus was something out of place. Intence survival expierience, and then relief at bonfire... or lost of hours of your life sometimes. Extremely intence. \nDS2 for me in the middle of this two.have lots of items, not terribly open, but have some corners, character is not perfectly responcive, but you have some options to make your playthrough easier etc. So, like a non-action survive..ish game it was pretty balanced and cool. And also very pretty and sometimes stunning with it visual desighn (not visual quality, artistic endevours)\nAnd then DS3 came. Playing the game I was never afraid to lost my progress, game feels EXTREMELEY polished and fair, and it all was very proactive, incentivized  movement and speed...... and i get very-very sad, coz i relized, after game like this they never would do something like first three.

I'll always see Dark Souls 2 as one of the most inconsistent games ever made. 25% of it is amazing, 50% of it forgettable, and 25% of it terrible... all while being frustrating to play through because of the core-movement and combat.\n\nI appreciate your video and your opinion, no hate towards you at all.

I also 100% agree with you that DS2 is \"detached\" from the other games; DS3 is a direct sequel to DS1, DS2 feels like more of a spinoff set in the same world. But despite that... as much as I love the first game, and the lore of it, my connection to the story just absolutely pales in comparison to DS2.\n\nI think this is for two major reasons; the first being, your character in DS2 feels like the most independent character in... well, any Souls-Like, really. In all the other ones you're some \"mystical undead / tarnished / whatever fated to be the one that saves the world, but actually you're just a puppet being strung along by gods or great old ones or whatever else. In DS2, you're not some prophecised being, you're a dude with a curse that wants to get rid of that curse. Everything you do and achieve in the game is YOUR work. Sure, you're still getting strung along by other beings. For a while. Until you start realising what's going on, because...\n\nReason 2; out of every Souls-Like game so far, the story of DS2 is the most comprehensible for a normal person playing the game. Again this is where SOTFS comes in because I understand Aldia is... different, or not even present in the original? But the dialogue he has along with item descriptions and the cut scenes, DS2 is the only game in the series where I got a pretty good idea of what was going on and what the main crux of the story was about without needing a vaatividya video to explain everything for me.\n\nAnd because of this, the game felt so much more personal. My character isn't some stalwart knight marching towards one of two endings that are in reality identical. They're an actual person with thoughts and ideas and beliefs. I like my DS1 and 3 characters, but I could roleplay my DS2 character in a D&D game and they'd actually be *fun*. And the concepts it brings to the series which are integral to the series' overall narrative; how the world is in an endless cycle where essentially the same things happen over and over, and there's this stupid, pointless battle between light and dark, where every how knows how many millenia we go from an age of light to an age of dark and everyone thinks they're doing something big but in reality it's pointless... That's like a core part of Dark Souls lore and it was like entirely created by Dark Souls 2. \n\nAND, it's the only game where it feels like, hey, *maybe* you're choices did actually matter, maybe you *will* find a different path. Like even the \"best\" ending in DS3 just kinda makes it feel like, nah, it's just all going to start over again.\n\nHonestly, while I like DS3's story and it's a nice wrap-up to the series, it's almost insulting how much it ignores the existence of Dark Souls 2.

Like having so many enemies in a area and taking the Iframes from things that give you it like pulling levers, going through dog walls, backstabs, etc. Again this doesn’t make me in a way dislike or hate the game (since I didn’t play it yet) but more about being scared to play it.", "authorDisplayName": "@DevilyKnight", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/F5OKB7kmZm0_GwjHjL-xx3ybsBfI8Z-CBh9HdLi9hVQERDeaQXMX05Z2U4drDioQ3s-uiXaL8KY=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@DevilyKnight", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC1NXBzGy704ZjSQxnRpJ2hQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2023-08-25T00:59:30Z", "updatedAt": "2023-08-25T00:59:30Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 1, "isPublic": true}}

No, I want *ACTUAL* continuity in my video games, thank you.\n\nIn short, DS2 is a cool idea thats pretty poorly implemented.  Too many janky, unrefined mechanics, too little depth to make me actually feel like it means something.  When the only actually good parts of the game are the DLC, you have a problem.", "authorDisplayName": "@josefsieffen18", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_n-K9cJEwThxU-wdG2S0yJTZvmnS63YXpqY2CbdEhRJcjU=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@josefsieffen18", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCUPGXZlDmaomj0CyZwsuXQQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2023-08-10T22:53:21Z", "updatedAt": "2023-08-10T23:03:44Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}

With the experience of those games, I went into DS2 curious to see what all the fuss was about. I liked a lot of things about the game. The locations were beautiful, the story was intriguing, Majula is a great hub area and that music is mesmerizing, going into the memories of the giants was a cool idea, Bonfire ascetics were fun to try out, I liked how backstab animations were different for each weapon instead of the same like in DS1 and 3, and although the map doesn't cross and intersect and loop back around like DS1 or Bloodborne do, I still liked that you had many different paths to choose from connecting to Majula. From the start I was really curious what was down that hole in Majula, but didn't have enough health to survive the fall. Eventually, going down there and discovering just how deep it went was a really cool experience. \nHowever, being experienced with the other Souls games, I couldn't help but notice that something about the gameplay felt off. The character was noticeably slower at everything, no matter the equip load. Rolling was slower, drinking estus was slower, the health filled up slowly and not instantly, the time it took roll after an attack or any animation was much longer, and for some reason I couldn't understand why I was still taking damage when I swore I dodged at the right time. That wasn't an issue I had in the other games and of course I had no idea adaptability was a thing. I struggled through most of the game thinking it was the wonky hitboxes everyone was talking about, until I finally read somewhere that leveling up adaptability increased your speed and invincibility frames when rolling. After leveling it up a little bit, all of a sudden the game felt how a Souls game should feel. Rolling and drinking were the right speed now. \nThis is one of many aspects of the game that were put in just to make it harder, but it wasn't fair difficulty, it was just for the sake of difficulty. Constantly being swarmed by too many enemies to handle at once, too many bosses were only challenging because they were a 3v1, having your max health be reduced with every death until you use an effigy, enemies' attacks had farther reach than you would expect, many enemies had combos that were just annoying and unpredictable, and the fact that your health fills up slowly caused so many deaths that wouldn't have happened in the other games.\nIt just makes it a less enjoyable experience overall.", "textOriginal": "I played Dark Souls 2 for the first time only after playing Bloodborne, Dark Souls 1 and 3, and Sekiro.

I also prefer DS2's boss progression and enemy placement (The original one) over DS3. Not to mention powerstancing is one of the coolest things inthe Souls series.

Now if this video was titled, \"Why you should still give DS2 a try\" or something to that effect I wouldn't be commenting, or at least not in this manner. The fact you're saying DS2 is criminally underrated I just find ridiculous.\n\nThe game isn't underrated, it's the sequel to an era and genre defining game. The game DS1 followed was just as genre defining but it managed to add enough to the formula that it still to this day gets concessions for huge flaws it has. DS1's world and level design did something in 3D space that is still to this day mind bending. Making your way back to bonfires to find they're already lit and that you were actually at that same location 15 or 20 minutes ago was such a fresh experience there is still hour long videos talking about it.\n\nDark Souls 2 had legendary boots to fill and didn't even have the full eye of the man who did most to bring the world into being and shepherded it to it's end later. What Dark Souls 2 does is in most areas is fall short, in a few it falls woefully short and in fewer still it improves or brings in new ideas. The game is clearly made in a way that misunderstands what makes so many of it's systems and combat scenarios work. It completely loses anywhere near the degree of world detail that made DS1s so special and desecrates the meaning of Boss in a from software game to a level that's only been surpassed by Elden Ring thus far.\n\nNow all this doesn't mean you can't like, enjoy or even prefer this game over it's brothers but you've basically shone a light on what you enjoyed and barely touched on the plain and clear issues people have with the game itself on it's own. Not to mention the issues that come from it having From Software as it's developer and the Dark Souls title on it. In doing so you've discounted a fair amount of your points. Just as you highlighted there's been a lot of defence and rousing of positive sentiment around the game since Mauler skewered it across 8 bloody hours. There has been just as many if not more highlighting it's flaws and shortcomings.\n\nThis all to say if you like the game and think people should try it that's fine, I like the game quite a lot. I even prefer it over 3 but it's below Bloodborne, DS1 and Sekiro and I think despite it being the poorest made Fromsoft game it's still enjoyable enough that it's worth slogging through it's weaker and frustrating areas because of the satisfaction of certain weapons, spells, boss encounters, levels and most of all it has some of the greatest music. When I suggest the game to others though I don't try and sell it as more than it is which this video is definitely doing from my perspective.\n\nIt's a very well done video, I hope this helps you make better content and perhaps think about your approach to argumentation in future.

Now, if you allow me, I want to do a break down of your video. Alright, shall we? Here we go:\n\n-) First, the intro:\n\nYou open up by broadcasting your bias towards the game. Nothing wrong with that, but puts your honesty into question. Next you mention people avoiding the game because of the hate. Who is \"people\" exactly? The consensus is that the majority of the Soulsborne community derides the game because it was such a catastrophic departure from the formula of Dark Souls.\n\nThen you mention how you are going to talk about the positives, and some of the negatives. Why just some? Why not all of them? There is a metric ton of objective criticism leveled at the game. \n\nFinally, you close by saying that this is your opinion and people should make their own, and then you encourage them to go play the game. Let me be clear: This is manipulative. If you are going to encourage people to make their own opinions, at the very least you should point them to videos that are critical of the game in order to balance the defense you are about to make.\n\n-) Now, unto Game's Mechanics:\n\nYou mention Bonfire Ascetics and how NG+ is handled. I agree, both are net positives for the game.\n\nNext is enemy placement feeling off. It is not off, it is sloppy and shit. You fail to mention the instances of enemies being placed in the world without rhyme or reason; you fail to mention the ad nauseam instances of spambush; you fail to mention the number of times enemies are placed in positions that will nearly guarantee you will take damage if not outright kill you.\n\nYou continue by bringing up the bosses and while you acknowledge that some are not good, some might be hits. Except you don't specify which ones are which. Lucky for everyone I can do it now:\n\nGOOD: the Pursuer, Looking Glass Knight, Flexile Sentry, Lost Sinner, Ruin Sentinels, Mytha the Baneful Queen, Smelter Demon, Veldstat, and Darklurker.\nMEDIOCRE: Executioner's Chariot, The Last Giant, The Rotten, Old Dragonslayer, Scorpioness Najka, Old Iron King, Giant Lord, Vendrick, and Ancient Dragon.\nSHIT: The Skeleton Lords, The Belfry Gargoyles, Royal Rat Vanguard, Royal Rat Authority, Duke's Dear Freja, Covetous Demon, Guardian Dragon, Demon of Song, Dragonrider, Twin Dragonriders, Prowling Magus and the Congregation, Throne Watcher and Defender, Nashandra, and Aldia.\n\nThen you make this strange point, as if it is a positive, that the bosses aesthetically fit the areas they are in. Are you implying that DS1 bosses didn't match aesthetically their own arenas? Because I find that to be a bizarre point to make.\n\n-) Next you move unto the world's design:\n\nYou state that the areas are aesthetically pleasing. Yes they are. But once again, you omit important information such as the many areas are ugly at the technical level with textures that are missing, flat, or washed out. Another thing you fail to mention is how BORING the world is in its layout. Where Dark Souls set the gold standard for world design, DS2 made this central hub with branches that stretch in a specific direction with zero interconnectivity, and all end on a dead end. You don't that some areas are so poorly designed that they overlap unto each other, but the player never sees it because they override each other when loaded unto the game (Aldea's keep for those interested). How about a volcano at the top of a tower, that stands alone in a poison ridden swamp?\n\n-) Next you move unto story:\n\nI am not messing with this one, because oh boy, that is a whole thesis unto its own.\n\n-) Extras:\n\nFirst, you mention lifegems, and you deviate into an opinion. So let me argue objectively: Lifegems break the game. There is no if or buts about it. Not only they are a powerful healing system that will keep you alive through most damage sources (except spambushes), but they are so abundant and cheap, that unless you utterly suck at the game, you will have 99 lifegems before the 5th hour mark. And likely will have over a hundred healing items by the end of your first run through the game. And they are not a \"back up option\" they are a full on replacement for the Estus.\n\nNext you mention that there are other negatives to the game, but you won't mention them. Why not? What is exactly stopping you from doing it? Don't you think that that is important information that you should make available to your subscribers, and viewers? Now, I appreciate that you are honest about ADP and animations, but I disagree that the janky hitboxes are somehow tied to ADP. The janky hitboxes are one of the many technical issues that the game has.\n\nAnd then, there is this: \"none of the negatives matter if you actually like the game\". This fucking line, and all the ones that follow are some of the most atrocious logic I ever heard in my life. You should never EVER excuse bad/lazy/incompetent design just because you like something. Because if we do that, then there is no point to having discussions about quality. By your logic then FIFA and NBA, and gatcha games, lootboxes, MTX and all other predatory forms of monetizing in a game are okay, because hey its just a negative you can understand and embrace in order to see the good in the game. You wanna love the game, love it all you want. But don't fucking ever excuse nonsense.\n\nThis is your logic: \"Hey I got molested at summer camp, but now I know how to canoe, alright!\" -- Dave Attell.\n\nFor anyone curious, DS2 got a lot of DESERVED hate for many things, including: janky hitboxes, ADP, overabundance of upgrade materials, unbalanced invasions, broken AI, lifegems, hack n' slash elements, overabundance of leveling points, idiotic contraptions, poorly designed world, terribly designed bosses, bloat of key type items, human effigies, adding obtuse problems and solutions to negate them, broken backstab, broken plunging attack, broken animations, broken sound, broken music, all of Scholar of the First Sin, broken netcode, broken PVP, replacing 360 movement with 8 directional snap points, broken jumping, broken falling, enemies instantaneously switching weapons, spambushes, excessive number of ambushes, downgraded graphic quality, unfinished systems, broken repair system, padded DLC, so on and on and on and on.\n\nFinally, for those wishing to delve deeper into the mess that DS2 is, I recommend you to watch HBombnerGuy's In Defense of Dark Souls 2, MauLer's A Response to In Defense of Dark Souls 2, Joseph Anderson's critique of DS2, and finally Matthew Mattosis' review of DS2.\n\nAs for you, Parker, I understand what you are trying to do. And I empathize. I love the Dark Souls series, and I actually enjoy Dark Souls 2 a lot. But the way you went about it to defend it, its no bueno. If you want to defend the game, you need to put your bias aside and let your viewers know why the Soulsborne community was so critical of DS2. And THEN  you make a case for why the game should be considered. You missed mentioning that DS2 has the largest pool of weapons, encouraging all sorts of cool builds, or that the overabundance of levels and upgrade materials allows for experimentation like none of the other games (outside of Elden Ring). The magic system in DS2 is far more robust than Demon Souls, DS1, and even DS3.

Which makes it feel more faithful as a sequel.\nDS2 could very well be an Elden Ring Sequel given its own logic", "authorDisplayName": "@Garl_Vinland", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_lE4g7H9igyTzQXxuAIxSXN8_Of5izi9w_vjYVOJ4BLyg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@Garl_Vinland", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCu7sai4p8XutxzO79mX4SLQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2023-03-07T05:02:16Z", "updatedAt": "2023-03-07T05:02:16Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 4, "isPublic": true}}

It’s more controversial and reviled mechanics are: SM (soul memory), Agl (agility, oft referred to as ADP/Adaptability- the iframe stat), numerous bonfires and bosses, despawning mobs, lose max hp after a death, get invaded while hollow, directional aiming with big weapons, lifegem hoarding, too many enemies, and unconnected map. \n\nI’ve discussed every complaint, so many times, and have rationales for each that have changed more than a few minds. The most important thing to keep in mind is that DS2 is a multiplayer game. PvE is trumped by making the game work for PvP.\n\n1. Soul Memory: conceptually, eliminates twinks from invading low level, and destroying with a bevy of maxed gear. Also, some players like that there’s a permanent consequence for losing bloodstains; your build gets watered down, so be careful. This example highlights why lifegem hoarding is detrimental. Your SM will increase, with no benefit to your build. PvP will be harder, as you meet players who only invest souls in stats and the gear they use. \n\n2. Agility (commonly referred to as ADP). As noted with SM, your “build” includes every soul, whether lost or spent. Iframes are extremely desirable, so NO ONE should get them for free. You want, you pay. There’s a skill to knowing if your opponent has invested many souls in getting them, lending interest to fights, as an opponent’s number of iframes is not so black and white. Main point, tho, is every build must invest to get them, and your SM reflects that. \n\n3. Numerous bosses & bonfires. This is simply to keep Bonfire Ascetics power in check. If they respawned vast areas, they would be too OP. Smaller areas associated with each bonfire are required. And more bosses are there to “fight” you for increasing the bonfire’s intensity. Though there are some bonfires that can be asceticked without needing to fight a boss. \n\n4. Despawning mobs. Basically preventing noobs from unintentionally jacking up their SM, and no longer able to find area-appropriate co-op. Prevents skilled players from farming items without any difficulties. RatBros won’t have an infinite army versus greys. \n\n5. Lose max hp after death. Basically a throw-back to Demons Souls. But less harsh. Instead of losing 50% after one death, lose 5%/death, up to 50%. Some people like the challenge, others don’t, but it’s a more player friendly version of a pervious mechanic. Love it or hate it. \n\n6. Get invaded while hollow: the price you pay for being able to go human anywhere, at any time. Multiplayer can be blocked, by burning an effigy at a bonfire. Precious though they may be, the small white soapstone can get you back human in less than 10 minutes. Using the multiplayer helps with effigy availability. \n\n7. Directional aiming: big weapons swing the direction your stick is held. Not towards lock on. This takes time to adjust to. But it helps big weapons to catch backstab fishing in PvP. Not particularly friendly for PvE. \n\n8. Lifegem (especially hoarding.) See #1 SM. Also, lifegems give the player a choice between big fast chug but immobile, or stay mobile, but get a small slow regen. If you buy 99, then complain that you can buy 99, Imma shake my head. \n\n9. Too many enemies: valid. Buy Vanilla DS2. You’re welcome. So different from Scholar, it’s like a new game. Easiest enemy placement, but much harder item placement.\n\n10. Unconnected map. It’s hard to follow DS1, who’s initial area is a masterpiece. But DS1 also gets the rose colored glasses treatment, and the whole game is praised for its interconnectivity. DS2 is basically Demons Souls, where it has spokes coming off a hub. But DS2 connects the spokes organically, instead of Demons “level selector” hub. DS2 does interconnected zones, like Lost Bastille. Huge interconnected areas. \n\nI hope I’ve given some food for thought.

First, don't ever feel bad for liking something. You can like something and it still be of bad quality, but that doesn't say anything about you personally. If you have fun playing the game, then it doesn't really matter what others think of it, you are having fun. Toward the end of the video you say you embrace the flaws, and I don't think we should be embracing them but rather understand them. I think no matter how much we adore something, it's important to discuss the issues in detail so that we can understand how and why they occured. That way an even better product can be created next time around.\n\nNext thing is New Game Plus. I both agree and disagree with you here. In terms of adding in or changing enemies and content for new game, I absolutely think thats a fantastic idea...In concept. However, DS2 already has an issue in regards to spam, and the game is flooded with enemies as is. New Game Plus adds more enemies ontop of what already was problematic simply exasperating the issue. You even show in your video how you were swarmed by enemies which was made worse by faulty AI causing them to chase you across the map. Conceptually, I really like the idea of changing up the enemies you fight, but it is unfortunately not handled well in the game. \n\nMoving onto the discussion about Bosses. When talking about the Pursuer, you mention his grab allowing him to cast new abilities if he pulls it off. This is something I think is pretty interesting as well, however in that same clip you also show off something really strange. When he does his grab attack, you may notice that your character is hit by the blade but then is jarringly moved to the blades end point. This might be considered a nitpick as you were hit regardless so its kind of just a weird visual. But that actually happens quite a bit with grab attacks in the game. The game often moves your character to be in place for the grab attack due to the god awful hit boxes in the game. This is something important to note because despite many bosses being fantastic, like Alonne, the wonky hit box issue will often create frustration and or confusion. You do mention hit boxes later in relation to ADP, but its unfortunately a separate issue that appears quite often. \n\nThen you start to praise the boss design because they fit their environments. Which is find to be an extremely strange thing to praise. This is something I would expect to be a standard, not out of the ordinary. It would be a hell of a lot stranger if they didn't fit their environments. The twisted firey bosses go in the firey area, the well kept knights go in a castle. It would be hilarious if the Demon of Song(A frog) was in Iron keep.\n\nI also agree that one of the biggest things to praise about DS2 are the visuals. Some areas, like those you showcased, can be stunning. I am still very partial to Medjula, It's my favorite hub area in any of the souls games. However, you also praise the game for how it presents its areas, saying you often get a distant view of where you are headed. And this is also something I find to be strange to praise. You get to see where you go at the back of the area, this happens in lots of games. The reason this is often praised in Souls games is because its usually not the area you are currently in but future areas. In DS1, you can see the walls of Anor Lando AND Blighttown from Firelink Shrine. In DS3 you can see many areas you'll head to from the bridge outside of Vordt. But what exactly is so special about seeing the castle at the back of the Dragon Aerie when you walk into the area? Is it because it looks cool? Fair enough, but again I wouldn't praise the game on its presentation of areas, I'd be praising the game on its visuals. \n\nThen you speak about Life Gems. This topic is definately one talked about quite heavily. But I feel you describe the issue quite well in why you actually like them. You say they are a great back up option if you run out of Estus, and thats kind of the whole issue to begin with. The point of Estus is to limit the player. You only have a certain amount, and as many often say it symbolizes your allowed amount of mistakes. If you mess up too much then you will run out and eventually die. But Life Gems destroy the whole point of having estus to begin with. Now the player has access to astronomically more healing than they otherwise would. That doesn't mean Life Gems are bad inherently. I think if they worked more like Bloodbornes Blood Vials, and they simply made it the specific way healing worked in the game, it would be fine. Maybe not let the player carry 99 at once, but oh well.  \n\nIf you couldn't tell, I disagree with your premise of the video. I think a great video series to watch is from Mauler. He made a reponse to Hbomberguy's DS2 video, and regardless of what you think of bomberguy, Mauler systematically breaks down large portions of the game in immense detail. It's a long watch, but it's quite informative. But just because I disagree with you doesn't mean I dont like the video. I appreciate you putting your thoughts out there, its a fun discussion to have!

Mana is a cringe and a very \"gamey\" system whereas the spells being a set amount makes it feel more like you're using scrolls to cast which is very thematic and feels a lot better while being very thematic\n\n#2 The various consumables and how fun they are to use. In literally every other game be it a souls one or not I never use consumables and forget about them, and yet this game makes it somehow fun to use consumables. There is such a huge variety and they are all so incredibly fun to use. I just don't understand why this game makes me so interested in it's consumables, the system is just in a league of its own.\n\n#3 The world layout, I've never felt so free in my vertical and horizontal movement. I truly feel like part of a world in DS2 and it feels like wherever I go I won't just be forced down a set path to reach my destination. \n\n#4 Scale. Holy does the game feel epic and everything feels so large. I've never had that same feeling with Elden ring or other souls games. Some areas in DS2 are truly ginormous and I especially like that each location feels like a fully fleshed-out location (except the royal rat area of course).\n\n#5 The animations. Some people (this youtuber included) mention animation time as a negative but I've never felt it that way. I've played and completed every single from soft souls like and nothing feels as good to me as DS2 combat. I love the flow of it, the combat dance you do, and the emphasis on spacing as if you're really fighting something. It's the closest representation to real-world combat. It's not some anime where I roll and do a cool move and then roll 4 times like in other souls games. It's a slow, methodical system that forces you to be careful when approaching situations. and the fact that stamina drains so quickly makes the game again feel more grounded in real combat. This also plays into DS2s world being the most grounded one we've seen, with less epic monsters and creatures and more of just dudes in armors, which helps set the tone and really makes seeing the beasts of the world feel all the more special.\n\n#6 Every NPC feels like they matter. I feel like every NPC has a part to play, and I always enjoy finding an NPC no matter who they are. In no other from soft game do I ever have that feeling, they are all unique and bring something special to the game they inhabit. Like it's super hard to pick a favorite. Like come on, what other souls game has a huge scorpion gladiator guy you can do a quest for to have him as a summon against a big scorpion boss (Najka fight) or a big dumb dwarf that'll buy your gear (only way to sell stuff in the game BTW) or just that guy that builds ladders for you for souls.

This is clear in even the concept arts. The castles actually look better in game than the highly detailed drawings.\nUnfortunately, a lot of Dark Souls 2 is played through boring tight corridors. This is something we've only seen before in Demon's Souls and never again. In typical dark souls 2 fashion, it does some amazing and daring things, but also makes pretty clear mistakes much worse than the rest of the series.\nAnd I think dark souls 2 (ever since Aldia was added) actually has the most interesting story.

This is clear in even the concept arts. The castles actually look better in game than the highly detailed drawings.\nUnfortunately, a lot of Dark Souls 2 is played through boring tight corridors. This is something we've only seen before in Demon's Souls and never again. In typical dark souls 2 fashion, it does some amazing and daring things, but also makes pretty clear mistakes much worse than the rest of the series.\nAnd I think dark souls 2 (ever since Aldia was added) actually has the most interesting story.

The first part is the themes of the loss of memory and self as you become more and more hollow.  You see this happen in real time with Lucatiel and a few others, but this is also happening to your character as well.  This is why the intro cutscene is so confusing.  It's because your character is themselves confused.  You came to Drangleic to... what?  You don't know.  The Emerald Herald instructs you to Bear Seek Seek Lest, but is that really _your_ goal, or a goal that someone else has imposed upon you?  You never actually find out for sure.\n\nThe second part of the story is the story of Vendrick, Aldia, and Nashandra.  Aldia, the Scholar of the First Sin, was trying to find a way to break the undead curse that was created by Gwyn (this is the titular First Sin).  Vendrick was helping him as best he could, and refused to link the fire in the hopes that Aldia would prove successful.  In the end, it was a failure, and Vendrick sealed himself away to prevent Nashandra from reaching the First Flame.  I think Aldia may have been able to break the curse for himself, and Vendrick's blessing if you get all the crowns will also break the curse for you, but they weren't able to break the curse for all humans.\n\nAt the end of the game, your choice is to either take the throne and usher in an Age of Fire _or_ Dark, or if you finish Aldia's questline you get the chance to take a third option.\n\nWhile DS3 does feel like more of a direct sequel to DS1, and DS2 feels like more of a spinoff, the story of DS3 makes a lot more sense with the additional context that DS2 provides.  DS3 is all about Prince Lothric refusing to link the fire, and the Lords of Cinder doing the same, but it's not made clear why.  DS2 was the first game to feature a character refusing to link the fire and explained what the reasons were.  DS3 really highlights that advanced state of decay of the world after linking the fire countless times, validating Vendrick and Aldia's refusal to link the fire and seek an alternate way to end the undead curse.", "textOriginal": "My take on the story is that it can be divided into two parts.
