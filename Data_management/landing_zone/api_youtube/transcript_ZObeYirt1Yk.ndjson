{"text": "be a little bit challenging at the", "start": 12.559, "duration": 2.401}
{"text": "beginning when you're first figuring out", "start": 13.759, "duration": 3.121}
{"text": "a lot of mechanics. And there are things", "start": 14.96, "duration": 3.76}
{"text": "that can just make your life easier if", "start": 16.88, "duration": 3.92}
{"text": "you know about them rather than finding", "start": 18.72, "duration": 3.68}
{"text": "out about them halfway through the game", "start": 20.8, "duration": 3.36}
{"text": "because that did not happen to me at", "start": 22.4, "duration": 3.28}
{"text": "all. So, the first thing we're going to", "start": 24.16, "duration": 3.439}
{"text": "discuss in this guide is weaknesses and", "start": 25.68, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "resistances. Just about every enemy in", "start": 27.599, "duration": 4.241}
{"text": "the game has a weakness or multiple", "start": 29.84, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "weaknesses or a resistance or multiple", "start": 31.84, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "resistances and then other damage types", "start": 33.84, "duration": 4.08}

{"text": "to try to be attacking the enemy's", "start": 37.92, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "weakness when possible. And if you're", "start": 39.28, "duration": 3.68}
{"text": "struggling in a fight, you should", "start": 41.52, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "consider swapping weapons to a different", "start": 42.96, "duration": 4.32}
{"text": "weapon or using a skill that does a", "start": 45.12, "duration": 4.64}
{"text": "different damage type in order to find", "start": 47.28, "duration": 4.32}
{"text": "the weakness of the enemy. It's it's a", "start": 49.76, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "good idea to keep different elements or", "start": 51.6, "duration": 3.76}
{"text": "different elemental skills across your", "start": 53.6, "duration": 4.32}
{"text": "team when you go into battle, especially", "start": 55.36, "duration": 3.999}
{"text": "if you're facing enemies for the first", "start": 57.92, "duration": 3.04}
{"text": "time and just kind of fumble around", "start": 59.359, "duration": 2.961}
{"text": "until you stumble upon what the", "start": 60.96, "duration": 3.279}
{"text": "weaknesses are so you know moving", "start": 62.32, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "forward and can deal the most damage to", "start": 64.239, "duration": 4.081}
{"text": "them. And for this reason as well, it's", "start": 66.32, "duration": 4.32}
{"text": "good to upgrade more than one weapon for", "start": 68.32, "duration": 4.88}
{"text": "each character so that you don't have", "start": 70.64, "duration": 4.24}
{"text": "like a problem when you switch to", "start": 73.2, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "another weapon and it's like really low", "start": 74.88, "duration": 3.279}
{"text": "level and its damage is terrible", "start": 76.72, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "compared to the one you're using. So", "start": 78.159, "duration": 4.161}
{"text": "definitely consider upgrading multiple", "start": 80.32, "duration": 3.36}
{"text": "elements and try and keep them like", "start": 82.32, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "maybe like opposite like a ice one and a", "start": 83.68, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "fire one or a light one and a dark one", "start": 85.92, "duration": 4.08}
{"text": "or something like that or even just you", "start": 87.84, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "know a little bit less adjacent like a", "start": 90.0, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "light and a fire or whatever something", "start": 92.0, "duration": 3.759}
{"text": "like that so that you have multiple", "start": 93.6, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "damage types of weapons that are", "start": 95.759, "duration": 3.36}
{"text": "upgraded. So the next thing I want to", "start": 97.2, "duration": 4.32}
{"text": "discuss is parrying and how important it", "start": 99.119, "duration": 3.761}
{"text": "is in this game. This is not something", "start": 101.52, "duration": 2.959}
{"text": "that should be shocking if you play the", "start": 102.88, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "demo or if you've played a little bit,", "start": 104.479, "duration": 4.081}
{"text": "but one tip I really want to give you is", "start": 106.72, "duration": 4.24}
{"text": "that the parry window for pairing in", "start": 108.56, "duration": 3.839}
{"text": "this game is not the same as what you", "start": 110.96, "duration": 4.24}
{"text": "would typically have in a game like this", "start": 112.399, "duration": 4.72}
{"text": "or in a Souls game, something like that,", "start": 115.2, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "where like if you're coming from Kazan", "start": 117.119, "duration": 3.761}
{"text": "or you're coming from a like Elden Ring", "start": 119.04, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "or something, the parry timing is", "start": 120.88, "duration": 3.279}
{"text": "actually a bit later in this game than", "start": 122.64, "duration": 3.28}
{"text": "it is in those games. You almost want to", "start": 124.159, "duration": 3.841}
{"text": "let the attack connect with you before", "start": 125.92, "duration": 4.559}
{"text": "you parry in order to pull off a parry", "start": 128.0, "duration": 4.879}
{"text": "rather than trying to parry the instant", "start": 130.479, "duration": 4.241}
{"text": "the beginning of the attack connects", "start": 132.879, "duration": 3.601}
{"text": "with you more like you want to be in the", "start": 134.72, "duration": 3.04}
{"text": "middle of the attack or towards the end", "start": 136.48, "duration": 3.04}
{"text": "of the attack when you parry. Something", "start": 137.76, "duration": 3.839}
{"text": "that I found is like holding the button", "start": 139.52, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "a little bit when you parry a little bit", "start": 141.599, "duration": 3.28}
{"text": "longer than you normally would seems to", "start": 143.04, "duration": 4.08}
{"text": "help as well. So adjust your parry", "start": 144.879, "duration": 4.08}
{"text": "timing and don't try and parry exactly", "start": 147.12, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "when the attack connects with you, but", "start": 148.959, "duration": 3.761}
{"text": "more of like in the middle of the attack", "start": 150.64, "duration": 3.44}
{"text": "connecting with you or just that tail", "start": 152.72, "duration": 4.519}
{"text": "end. Another really important tip is", "start": 154.08, "duration": 6.799}
{"text": "that Lun has access to a revive skill", "start": 157.239, "duration": 5.961}
{"text": "that she can get for her kit very early", "start": 160.879, "duration": 5.121}
{"text": "on in the game, and I highly recommend", "start": 163.2, "duration": 5.36}
{"text": "getting this skill immediately. And it", "start": 166.0, "duration": 5.2}
{"text": "might be the easiest way in the game to", "start": 168.56, "duration": 4.48}
{"text": "beat fights is to keep Luna in your", "start": 171.2, "duration": 4.399}
{"text": "party and to revive whenever you need to", "start": 173.04, "duration": 4.559}
{"text": "revive characters. It's not always", "start": 175.599, "duration": 3.681}
{"text": "possible, like if Luna dies or something", "start": 177.599, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "like that, but generally speaking, as", "start": 179.28, "duration": 3.92}
{"text": "long as she has the skill points and can", "start": 181.599, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "throw a revive, you can keep deflecting", "start": 183.2, "duration": 4.959}
{"text": "and dodging attacks to stay alive until", "start": 185.599, "duration": 4.241}
{"text": "you can get everyone back up and then", "start": 188.159, "duration": 3.841}
{"text": "get back into the fight. So Lun's revive", "start": 189.84, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "skill is almost a must if you're having", "start": 192.0, "duration": 3.599}
{"text": "a tough time with this game. If you're", "start": 193.68, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "not having a challenging time, then you", "start": 195.599, "duration": 2.961}
{"text": "don't need it. I didn't use it for", "start": 197.2, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "probably like half the game until one of", "start": 198.56, "duration": 4.64}
{"text": "my colleagues was like, \"Oh, by the way,", "start": 201.36, "duration": 3.68}
{"text": "Luna's revive skill is so OP. It's", "start": 203.2, "duration": 3.039}
{"text": "making the game super easy.\" And I was", "start": 205.04, "duration": 3.919}
{"text": "like, \"She has a revive skill.\" So, it's", "start": 206.239, "duration": 3.841}
{"text": "definitely very good. And if you're", "start": 208.959, "duration": 2.401}
{"text": "having a tough time, particularly if", "start": 210.08, "duration": 2.32}
{"text": "you're playing on like the hardest", "start": 211.36, "duration": 2.959}
{"text": "difficulty, make sure you have that", "start": 212.4, "duration": 3.839}
{"text": "skill. So, the next thing worth noting", "start": 214.319, "duration": 3.2}
{"text": "is something that I figured it out", "start": 216.239, "duration": 3.121}
{"text": "because I had like a bug or two that I", "start": 217.519, "duration": 4.161}
{"text": "had to like reload in order to prevent", "start": 219.36, "duration": 4.48}
{"text": "uh a scenario where I couldn't progress", "start": 221.68, "duration": 4.08}
{"text": "is that even though the game only has", "start": 223.84, "duration": 3.36}
{"text": "one save file in the sense that like", "start": 225.76, "duration": 2.72}
{"text": "when you load into the game, when you go", "start": 227.2, "duration": 2.64}
{"text": "to load up your game when you first", "start": 228.48, "duration": 3.679}
{"text": "start it, you can only pick that that", "start": 229.84, "duration": 3.679}
{"text": "one playthrough or another playthrough", "start": 232.159, "duration": 2.321}
{"text": "from a different character, another", "start": 233.519, "duration": 2.561}
{"text": "playthrough, like there isn't multiple", "start": 234.48, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "save slots for that that playthrough", "start": 236.08, "duration": 4.079}
{"text": "that you can reload. There is a load", "start": 238.0, "duration": 3.68}
{"text": "previous saves from the menu while", "start": 240.159, "duration": 3.761}
{"text": "you're still in the game. So, like if", "start": 241.68, "duration": 3.919}
{"text": "you if you get in a situation where like", "start": 243.92, "duration": 3.039}
{"text": "you made a decision, you wish you could", "start": 245.599, "duration": 3.441}
{"text": "undo it or you messed something up and", "start": 246.959, "duration": 4.321}
{"text": "you want to go back, if you hit escape", "start": 249.04, "duration": 4.88}
{"text": "and go or go to the menu and find load", "start": 251.28, "duration": 4.959}
{"text": "previous saves, there are like a handful", "start": 253.92, "duration": 4.559}
{"text": "of previous saves that you can reload in", "start": 256.239, "duration": 4.881}
{"text": "order to backtrack a little ways and be", "start": 258.479, "duration": 4.321}
{"text": "able to undo a mistake that you made.", "start": 261.12, "duration": 3.12}
{"text": "So, make sure you use that if you need", "start": 262.8, "duration": 2.959}
{"text": "it. So, let's talk a little bit about", "start": 264.24, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "Picto next and which ones are good early", "start": 265.759, "duration": 4.321}
{"text": "on. Typically, early on in the game,", "start": 267.84, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "what you're focused on is two things.", "start": 270.08, "duration": 4.88}
{"text": "dealing the most damage as you can and", "start": 271.84, "duration": 5.04}
{"text": "getting as many action points as you can", "start": 274.96, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "so that you can use more skills. In the", "start": 276.88, "duration": 3.68}
{"text": "beginning of the game, you don't have as", "start": 278.8, "duration": 3.28}
{"text": "many ways to gain action points, so", "start": 280.56, "duration": 3.76}
{"text": "you're basic attacking a lot, but you", "start": 282.08, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "want to change that by getting action", "start": 284.32, "duration": 2.72}
{"text": "points. So, look for pictos with action", "start": 285.6, "duration": 3.36}
{"text": "points and look for pictos that are", "start": 287.04, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "going to boost your damage. Now, as you", "start": 288.96, "duration": 3.92}
{"text": "get further and further into the game,", "start": 290.56, "duration": 4.56}
{"text": "you'll start to realize that the passive", "start": 292.88, "duration": 4.4}
{"text": "bonuses on your pictos become more and", "start": 295.12, "duration": 5.12}
{"text": "more important. And once that starts", "start": 297.28, "duration": 4.639}
{"text": "happening, you're going to have to keep", "start": 300.24, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "like changing your pictos out to get", "start": 301.919, "duration": 4.801}
{"text": "higher and higher stats. And health is a", "start": 304.08, "duration": 4.88}
{"text": "very, very valuable one because the", "start": 306.72, "duration": 4.479}
{"text": "thing about health is it makes sure that", "start": 308.96, "duration": 4.32}
{"text": "you stay alive and it lets you put your", "start": 311.199, "duration": 4.641}
{"text": "points into, you know, whatever your", "start": 313.28, "duration": 4.4}
{"text": "weapons scale with. And also, there's a", "start": 315.84, "duration": 4.24}
{"text": "lot of effects that heal you based on", "start": 317.68, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "your max health. So the higher your max", "start": 320.08, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "health is, the more they heal you. And", "start": 321.84, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "obviously, the more hits you can absorb", "start": 324.24, "duration": 3.36}
{"text": "in combat. And the more hits you can", "start": 325.84, "duration": 3.359}
{"text": "absorb, the more you can learn attack", "start": 327.6, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "patterns of enemies before you wipe, so", "start": 329.199, "duration": 4.72}
{"text": "that when you go into a fight next time,", "start": 331.44, "duration": 4.4}
{"text": "you understand the attack pattern a bit", "start": 333.919, "duration": 3.201}
{"text": "better and you have a better chance of", "start": 335.84, "duration": 3.04}
{"text": "survival. The next thing I want to talk", "start": 337.12, "duration": 3.68}
{"text": "a little bit about is multi-hit attacks", "start": 338.88, "duration": 5.12}
{"text": "and attacks with less hits. Early on in", "start": 340.8, "duration": 6.56}
{"text": "the game, you have a damage cap at 9,999", "start": 344.0, "duration": 5.039}
{"text": "damage, meaning you cannot deal more", "start": 347.36, "duration": 3.44}
{"text": "than that no matter what you do. And so", "start": 349.039, "duration": 3.361}
{"text": "once you get about a third of the way of", "start": 350.8, "duration": 3.44}
{"text": "the game or so, you're going to start", "start": 352.4, "duration": 4.639}
{"text": "realizing that the damage that you're", "start": 354.24, "duration": 4.88}
{"text": "dealing is capped from that in a way", "start": 357.039, "duration": 4.321}
{"text": "that mult it skews you towards multi-hit", "start": 359.12, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "attacks because multi-hit attacks, if", "start": 361.36, "duration": 4.72}
{"text": "they all deal 9,999 damage, comes out to", "start": 362.96, "duration": 5.04}
{"text": "be more damage than if you do a onehit", "start": 366.08, "duration": 3.839}
{"text": "attack that does that. So you want to be", "start": 368.0, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "on the lookout for skills that do multi", "start": 369.919, "duration": 4.72}
{"text": "hits early on in the game. And later on", "start": 371.84, "duration": 4.56}
{"text": "in the game, you'll be able to lift that", "start": 374.639, "duration": 4.721}
{"text": "damage cap. So know that. and then it", "start": 376.4, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "kind of balances out and you can use", "start": 379.36, "duration": 3.04}
{"text": "whatever you like. But early on, pay", "start": 380.56, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "attention to multi-hit attacks. And", "start": 382.4, "duration": 4.56}
{"text": "also, because multi-hit attacks have a", "start": 384.4, "duration": 4.88}
{"text": "chance to crit for each attack that they", "start": 386.96, "duration": 5.04}
{"text": "do, if you have effects that trigger on", "start": 389.28, "duration": 4.8}
{"text": "crit, the more attacks you do, the more", "start": 392.0, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "likely you're going to get crits that", "start": 394.08, "duration": 3.119}
{"text": "will trigger those effects. So, they're", "start": 395.52, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "just generally better as a whole. This", "start": 397.199, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "doesn't mean that every skill is better,", "start": 399.52, "duration": 2.72}
{"text": "but generally, you're going to want to", "start": 401.199, "duration": 2.56}
{"text": "look for multi-hit attacks, especially", "start": 402.24, "duration": 3.12}
{"text": "early on. The next thing I want to", "start": 403.759, "duration": 3.521}
{"text": "mention is use your tints. You can use", "start": 405.36, "duration": 3.679}
{"text": "your energy tints, your healing tints,", "start": 407.28, "duration": 3.039}
{"text": "your revive tints, especially your", "start": 409.039, "duration": 2.961}
{"text": "revive tints. Especially if you don't", "start": 410.319, "duration": 3.921}
{"text": "have Luna in your party. These all", "start": 412.0, "duration": 5.199}

{"text": "I used my revive, now I don't have any.", "start": 419.52, "duration": 3.519}
{"text": "Like, they will replenish each time you", "start": 421.199, "duration": 3.681}
{"text": "get to a checkpoint. So, make sure you", "start": 423.039, "duration": 3.361}
{"text": "use them in between checkpoints. Like,", "start": 424.88, "duration": 3.36}
{"text": "they're there to be used. If you need to", "start": 426.4, "duration": 3.44}
{"text": "heal, heal. If you need to revive,", "start": 428.24, "duration": 3.44}
{"text": "revive or whatever. You can only use", "start": 429.84, "duration": 3.199}
{"text": "these in combat, though. You can't use", "start": 431.68, "duration": 3.44}
{"text": "them outside of combat. So, make sure", "start": 433.039, "duration": 3.521}
{"text": "that you use them while you're in combat", "start": 435.12, "duration": 3.199}
{"text": "if you need them. The next thing, which", "start": 436.56, "duration": 3.359}
{"text": "I think you will probably figure out,", "start": 438.319, "duration": 3.681}
