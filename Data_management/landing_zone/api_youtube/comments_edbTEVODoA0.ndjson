I have my problems with DS2, but the amount of \"checkpoints\" you get is perfect in my opinion. Dark Souls 3 gives you far too many, Dark Souls 1 gives you too few (like in Sen's Fortress, which is an excellent area but super frustrating for new players because of a lack of checkpoints). Checkpoints in DS2 do always come in the form of a bonfire rather than shortcuts, which is a shame. Forest of the Fallen Giant actually started off so strong with all paths warping back to the bonfire, but they decided to forego that mentality for a lot of their later levels. Still, No Man's Wharf and Undead Crypt have intelligent shortcut design in my opinion.\n\nOther than that I completely agree with your biggest issue with DS2, which is that every encounter is the same and there's far too many of them. Bait out one of the guys with range, watch all surrounding guys aggro and slowly pick them off. Walk 2 meters forward, pick off a new group of enemies. And so on. It's boring and sluggish. If you try to play at a quicker pace, you're just gonna get ganked and die. It's not fun.\n\nAlso, because of the way movement works in DS2 you don't have complete 360 degree control over your character. So, walking small ledges and navigating near pits can be frustrating to say the least. Yet DS2 does absolutely nothing to accomodate this new movement system. There's so many levels with small ledges, small platforms, etc.\n\n\nThen there's the bosses. In my opinion you were far too lenient on them. Dark Souls 2s bosses are awful. All of them are the same enemy. Wow you have a double slash and an overhead slam? How original! There are good bosses here, but when Lost Sinner (which literally has the exact same moveset as any other enemy in this game) is considered to be one of the best bosses then you have an issue.

Have no idea why they never included this in later titled like DS3 & Elden Ring. Being able to create a Lightning MGS or a Fire Smelter Sword, Then BUFF the weapon on top of that is such a badass thing to let you do lol, NG+/Bonfire Aesthetic is another area DS2 knocks it out of the park, Having new stuff in NG+ is very cool, And being able to replay thru any area and its boss is amazing as well. Covenants and PVP is also at its absolute best in DS2 IMO, Overall, From what many generally expect from a \"Souls\" Game, It's easy to see why its considered the weakest, But as an overall RPG, I think it's the most \"Adventure RPG\" Out of the trilogy, And its a top tier game in Fromsofts catalog. Personally, Including DLCs, It's tied at 3 for my favorite Fromsoft game, I legitimately prefer SOTFS over Elden Ring, Atmosphere man, Elden Ring is incredible but its areas never evoked the same type of feelings as DS2 areas did. Even the BS areas like Shrine Of Amana or Black Gultch aesthetically stand out and make me feel things i never felt in Elden Rings open world.

It is like a skirmish, you have four loyal white Loyce knights and about 2 or 3 summons!! You and your PLATOON fight against many charred knights, it feels like a mini war. Then the king arrives... so much fun!\n\n14:23 Aside from graphics downgrade, the level design was the most affected aspect of this game, it wasn't lazyness, it was lack of time. I agree DS1 has better level design than DS2, but i can say DS1 has the best level design of ALL souls. \n\n16:38 No, you actually NEED bonfires fast travel, because this game has BONFIRE ASCETICS! And some times, for some areas, you need to level up first and come again later with more power, so you can burn an ascetic. So yes, you actually need fast travel bonfires. Do you know wich game has a lot of bonefires and fast travel from the start but ascetics doesn't exist and you clean every level with one run?

The Iron Keep is really not as horrid as you guys paint it out to be. \n\n19:13 they didn’t pop up out of “nowhere” you need to *look around* and you’ll see the 4 Alonne Knights on the top of the building. Also, Ds3 and Ds1 suffer just as much “gank” as this game, the only difference being; Miyazaki had a hand in Ds1 and 3, thus creating much more unnecessary biased against this already, hate barraged game. \n\nI’m pretty certain the iFrame removal was for pvp purposes because lots of invaders were complaining about it. \n\nIf you remember 10 years ago, in Vanilla that cage outside the Sol was not there. That was the shortcut. \n\n23:34 there’s numerous areas in Ds1 and Ds3 that I could say that exact sentence about. Yet no one’s complaining about them.
