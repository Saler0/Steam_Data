{"text": "to say that right at the beginning here", "start": 154.72, "duration": 3.92}

{"text": "that might get a little undersold thanks", "start": 171.84, "duration": 3.679}

{"text": "going to be make or break for this.", "start": 179.84, "duration": 4.24}
{"text": "mostly because it comes down a lot to", "start": 181.44, "duration": 5.2}
{"text": "QTE. And with my experience with this", "start": 184.08, "duration": 4.799}

{"text": "reduces the need to rely on those", "start": 188.879, "duration": 4.481}
{"text": "things, I found to not have that crazy", "start": 190.56, "duration": 5.2}
{"text": "of an effect on them. So, when enemies", "start": 193.36, "duration": 4.56}
{"text": "attack you, you'll have to try to dodge", "start": 195.76, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "or parry to mitigate damage. In fact,", "start": 197.92, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "you can just no hit bosses and", "start": 199.92, "duration": 3.12}
{"text": "everything if you manage to do this", "start": 201.44, "duration": 3.28}
{"text": "well. Now, there's not much you can do", "start": 203.04, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "about that. That just is the combat", "start": 204.72, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "mechanics. Now, on the flip side, when", "start": 206.64, "duration": 3.679}
{"text": "you attack enemies, there are sometimes", "start": 208.56, "duration": 4.239}
{"text": "little QTE to perform extra effects or", "start": 210.319, "duration": 4.48}
{"text": "damage. And in some extreme cases, even", "start": 212.799, "duration": 4.321}
{"text": "avoid damage to yourself or failing the", "start": 214.799, "duration": 4.401}
{"text": "attack at all. In the options, you can", "start": 217.12, "duration": 4.399}

{"text": "don't have to worry about those. But the", "start": 221.519, "duration": 4.401}
{"text": "incoming stuff isn't a negotiable aspect", "start": 222.959, "duration": 4.961}
{"text": "of this game. And as I mentioned, while", "start": 225.92, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "the difficulty options say it's going to", "start": 227.92, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "reduce the reliance on this after", "start": 230.08, "duration": 2.719}

{"text": "difficulties, which you can freely", "start": 232.799, "duration": 3.921}
{"text": "change, I found that to not really be", "start": 234.239, "duration": 4.401}
{"text": "true in most cases, especially for the", "start": 236.72, "duration": 3.68}
{"text": "optional stuff. Maybe it's true for the", "start": 238.64, "duration": 3.36}
{"text": "critical path, which is frankly a bit", "start": 240.4, "duration": 3.28}
{"text": "easier than some of the optional in-game", "start": 242.0, "duration": 4.239}
{"text": "things. Because with that stuff, um,", "start": 243.68, "duration": 4.96}
{"text": "frankly, those enemies and bosses will", "start": 246.239, "duration": 4.961}
{"text": "one-shot you if you miss those things on", "start": 248.64, "duration": 4.72}

{"text": "much so that I actually wouldn't be", "start": 253.36, "duration": 2.879}
{"text": "surprised if this winds up getting a", "start": 254.799, "duration": 3.361}
{"text": "balance pass because I literally", "start": 256.239, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "couldn't tell you the difference between", "start": 258.16, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "most of those. But from there, let's", "start": 259.759, "duration": 3.841}
{"text": "talk the technical state. I had this", "start": 261.68, "duration": 4.079}
{"text": "game for a while. How was it running?", "start": 263.6, "duration": 4.319}
{"text": "So, two things I wanted to note here are", "start": 265.759, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "primarily that uh unfortunately I did", "start": 267.919, "duration": 4.801}
{"text": "have a lot of crashes over roughly 60", "start": 269.919, "duration": 4.321}
{"text": "hours with this game. It crashed at", "start": 272.72, "duration": 3.199}
{"text": "least a dozen times. I kind of just", "start": 274.24, "duration": 3.519}
{"text": "stopped counting after a little while. I", "start": 275.919, "duration": 3.521}
{"text": "always do a little bit of research into", "start": 277.759, "duration": 3.281}
{"text": "the why when that kind of thing happens", "start": 279.44, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "and I could not track down a specific", "start": 281.04, "duration": 4.4}
{"text": "cause, at least on my own. Uh sometimes", "start": 283.04, "duration": 4.08}
{"text": "problems with drivers will cause that", "start": 285.44, "duration": 3.12}
{"text": "sort of thing, especially with review", "start": 287.12, "duration": 3.519}
{"text": "copies. And with this being ahead of the", "start": 288.56, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "official release, I don't know how it's", "start": 290.639, "duration": 2.881}
{"text": "going to run for everybody else, but", "start": 292.08, "duration": 3.679}
{"text": "again, left a bit to be desired there.", "start": 293.52, "duration": 3.76}
{"text": "Now, what's more in this section of the", "start": 295.759, "duration": 3.601}
{"text": "video, I actually wanted to mention that", "start": 297.28, "duration": 3.76}
{"text": "the game does feature quite a few", "start": 299.36, "duration": 3.839}
{"text": "options to again customize little stuff", "start": 301.04, "duration": 3.36}
{"text": "like, you know, do you want to be", "start": 303.199, "duration": 3.44}
{"text": "affected by QTS on your abilities, stuff", "start": 304.4, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "like that. and it may be worth engaging", "start": 306.639, "duration": 3.601}
{"text": "with that stuff to kind of figure out if", "start": 308.4, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "this is uh up your alley, so to speak,", "start": 310.24, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "or if that would be something you want.", "start": 312.24, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "But moving on from there, let's talk", "start": 314.24, "duration": 3.76}
{"text": "about difficulty. So, my main thing", "start": 315.84, "duration": 3.68}
{"text": "about difficulty that I already", "start": 318.0, "duration": 3.44}
{"text": "mentioned is that I felt little", "start": 319.52, "duration": 3.92}
{"text": "difference between them because of how", "start": 321.44, "duration": 4.8}
{"text": "the active elements of combat work, but", "start": 323.44, "duration": 4.72}
{"text": "we do have three options essentially,", "start": 326.24, "duration": 3.6}
{"text": "easy, normal, hard, and what they are", "start": 328.16, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "supposed to do is affect enemy damage", "start": 329.84, "duration": 3.52}
{"text": "and then how easy those dodge and", "start": 331.68, "duration": 3.519}
{"text": "parries are to pull off. But to", "start": 333.36, "duration": 3.76}
{"text": "reiterate, I felt very little difference", "start": 335.199, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "between any of these, not least of which", "start": 337.12, "duration": 4.48}
{"text": "because it is pretty easy overall to", "start": 339.039, "duration": 4.481}
{"text": "deal with the uh sort of critical path", "start": 341.6, "duration": 3.28}
{"text": "through the story either by just", "start": 343.52, "duration": 3.2}
{"text": "overleveling or grinding as with many", "start": 344.88, "duration": 3.759}
{"text": "JRPGs, which is going to eliminate most", "start": 346.72, "duration": 3.759}
{"text": "of the difficulty there, especially once", "start": 348.639, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "the game opens up and you can kind of do", "start": 350.479, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "everything before the sort of end scene.", "start": 352.479, "duration": 4.241}
{"text": "But when it comes to the optional stuff", "start": 354.639, "duration": 4.801}
{"text": "like the super bosses, endgame optional", "start": 356.72, "duration": 4.479}
{"text": "encounters, stuff like that, a lot of", "start": 359.44, "duration": 4.08}
{"text": "those guys have abilities that are", "start": 361.199, "duration": 4.56}
{"text": "basically one shots if you miss the", "start": 363.52, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "dodge or the parry or anything like", "start": 365.759, "duration": 3.921}
{"text": "that. And as a result of that being on", "start": 367.52, "duration": 4.399}
{"text": "every single difficulty, it really just", "start": 369.68, "duration": 4.639}
{"text": "reinforced my feeling that if you don't", "start": 371.919, "duration": 4.321}
{"text": "enjoy this type of combat, you're", "start": 374.319, "duration": 3.841}
{"text": "probably just not going to enjoy this", "start": 376.24, "duration": 4.079}
{"text": "game. But if you like it, it's a pretty", "start": 378.16, "duration": 4.24}
{"text": "great time. That brings me to the story", "start": 380.319, "duration": 4.88}
{"text": "setup and my thoughts on that. So again,", "start": 382.4, "duration": 5.04}
{"text": "going to try to avoid spoilers here. Not", "start": 385.199, "duration": 4.401}
{"text": "going in depth on a lot of this simply", "start": 387.44, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "because of the fact that we're ahead of", "start": 389.6, "duration": 3.599}
{"text": "the release date, and it's also a really", "start": 391.44, "duration": 3.199}
{"text": "good story that I want people to", "start": 393.199, "duration": 3.601}
{"text": "experience. But again, we are playing as", "start": 394.639, "duration": 4.801}

{"text": "about that journey. But not only that", "start": 412.08, "duration": 4.32}
{"text": "journey, but also asking questions like", "start": 413.919, "duration": 4.56}
{"text": "why is this happening? What is this all", "start": 416.4, "duration": 4.32}
{"text": "about? Who all of these people are? And", "start": 418.479, "duration": 4.241}

{"text": "zoomed out version of all that stuff,", "start": 444.24, "duration": 4.239}

{"text": "little message to be super accurate. It", "start": 772.88, "duration": 4.56}
{"text": "was usually worthwhile to level up until", "start": 774.88, "duration": 4.399}
{"text": "that little disclaimer fell off. And", "start": 777.44, "duration": 3.28}
{"text": "then at that point, I was pretty much", "start": 779.279, "duration": 3.441}
{"text": "good to go every single time. Now, as", "start": 780.72, "duration": 3.679}

{"text": "is a whole host of optional stuff. Now,", "start": 796.959, "duration": 4.961}

{"text": "over like mountains and stuff, which", "start": 809.6, "duration": 3.2}
{"text": "makes getting around a little bit", "start": 811.36, "duration": 2.96}
{"text": "easier. And then once you actually get", "start": 812.8, "duration": 3.76}

{"text": "all that, but let's talk about the", "start": 821.839, "duration": 3.521}

{"text": "exploring a given area. So this is where", "start": 825.36, "duration": 3.919}
{"text": "the game in addition to things like the", "start": 827.6, "duration": 3.359}
{"text": "attributes I would say definitely takes", "start": 829.279, "duration": 3.921}
{"text": "some notes from souls like in terms of", "start": 830.959, "duration": 4.641}

{"text": "design you can definitely kind of see", "start": 837.279, "duration": 3.761}
{"text": "the influence there. That is to say we", "start": 838.8, "duration": 4.08}
{"text": "see things like checkpoints where we can", "start": 841.04, "duration": 3.84}
{"text": "rest to uh respawn enemies if you're", "start": 842.88, "duration": 3.759}

{"text": "you just want to knock out your pictos", "start": 846.639, "duration": 2.88}
{"text": "or something. And this is also where", "start": 848.24, "duration": 3.2}
{"text": "you'll level up, refuel and whatnot", "start": 849.519, "duration": 3.601}
