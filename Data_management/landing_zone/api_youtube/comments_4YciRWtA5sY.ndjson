Which makes aggro behave so much differently from version to version. In Scholar's it's much easier to kill enemies one at a time, but in the Vanilla version, often times aggroing one enemy will aggro several in the area. This leads to a lot of the insane ganks in the vanilla version. You can see this very quickly in the first bonfire in Forest of the Giants, in Vanilla aggroing one dude aggros at least 4 others, with an archer with increased range. No Man's Wharf has a similar thing, there's a house where if you aggro two vikings, three will come up the stairs. The Shrine of Amana has the same thing, the knights will often aggro alongside the magic users, the hippo would often aggro too, which for me makes the Vanilla version of this area MUCH worse. This maybe harder to notice as a melee character naturally, but as a ranged character it's quite noticeable.\n\nI think a lot of misconceptions about Scholar's come from veterans coming to Scholar's after having played vanilla near release. Having partially forgotten how crazy Vanilla could get, so the ganks in Scholar's feels extra, even when it's not extra compared to Vanilla. I'm included in this, I played a bit of Scholar's a few years back and thought the ganks were ridiculous so I gave up. Came back to it last month, and comparing it to videos of Vanilla, and it's often times more ridiculous in Vanilla. The ganks are still there in Scholar's, and they still suck imo, but it's more manageable. Though I do think Scholar is a bit easier, either I've gotten much better at Dark Souls over the years, but many bosses feel easier.\n\nI think something not mentioned in many comparison videos is that on a whole, enemy locations and item placement conforms to lore better in Scholar's. They put more thought into a lot of it, and it's easy to tell. Heide's Tower has a lot of Heide knights, because it's their castle. Aldia's Keep has many of his experiments near by.

One thing that I clearly CLEARLY remember, even from 3 years ago, was how much I did not have a great time playing vanilla DS2. Strong bias here, I know, but as my memory of it is, it was so bad that when I finally did beat the game, I kinda told myself \"nope, that's it, no NG+, never touching this game again with a 2-meter long pole\". (I didn't have the DLCs btw).\n\nI played a ton of DS1 and made a buncha videos even on that since it seems to be my favorite, played 3 into like NG+4 or something, and then of course Elden Ring rolled out and I lost like half a year to just playing that every day. I keep circling back to DS1 for some reason because to me, although its janky, it just \"feels\" enjoyable to play, and I can honestly say that SotFS might also be a game like that. 3 definitely is a circle back game, ER not so much because its just too damn big.\n\nAnyways, about 1 week ago I decided to give SotFS a chance, and I have to say that I actually enjoyed it. I loved how you were constantly invaded by NPCs, loved how they gave you so many weapons and ways to easily level up not only the character, but all the Titanite they give you, the DLCs were very easy but enjoyable, I actually legit struggled with the Fume Knight boss fight and that'll probably live in my head now rent free, etc etc. There were some places though that were just a slog, like the run-ups to the second blue Smelter Demon and Sir Alonne were so bad that I just literally cleared the areas 12 times in a row so that enemies wouldn't respawn. I actually think I died more in SotFS (compared to you it was like half compared to vanilla), so completely the opposite, but also in SotFS I was always trying to explore every nook and cranny, and some bosses in the DLC were really tricky. In DS2, I was for some reason not that interested and mainly rushed through the game.\nWell, not to go on now and write a small novel, I'd say SotFS is much much better, and I definitely will be replaying it in the near future :D\nNice work and keep up the great videos!", "textOriginal": "This was an excellent video, and overall I agree with both your objective and bias points of view!

AGL is the important number, you should get it to 100 as fast as possible (25 ADP for non magic users or 30 ATN + 17 ADP for magic *pyros, hexers, and miracles included* users is enough, no more lvls needed).

I don't know if they're there in the vanilla game), bosses in general were supposed to be more of a threat before the bossfight in their arena (leftover of this is Duke's Dear Freja appearing early in NG+, and any damage you deal to it carrying over for the real bossfight).\n\n5:47 these enemies appear here on SOTFS, but only on NG+ and beyond.\n\n8:20 in SOTFS there's no need to fight all the Heide knights, but I can't blame you for thinking this.

It turnus out that the game is TERRIBLE comparing to DS1. Thoose waepons made out of paper because they were getting broken so goddamn fast, cutting a piece of your max HP after every death, big amouns of enemies everywhere, lack of Estus Flasks and healing at all at the first half of the game is so annoying.... I remember I was playing like a Hedgehog, afraid of every unknown corner of the room and constantly using shield because I was afraid to die so I will suffer reaching my lost souls even more. Also I don't like that character movement, I can't feel any effort of rolling/doging/doing a parry, or at least try to do a parry, because I used to DS1 timings so much. Thank god I found a guy on Steam Disscousions who wanted to rebeat original game, because he haven't played it since SOFTS was released, he helped me really a lot, I am surely would not be able to beat the game without that guy, we made out almost a half of the game and he was a nice guy to talk. And speaking of Coop, this is the only thing I liked about DS2 because my Dark Souls journey started in late 2022, and it was Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition, and Bandai Namco shuted down multiplayer by that time. Soul Memory is kinda frustrating but we dealt with it pretty much without any big problems. The game wasn't that bad, I even tried to play some DLC`s. I made out to get that CRown of Sunken King, but when I reached another Smelter Demon from \"Crown of the Old Iron King\" and died to it a hundred times... I just thought that is enough for me... DLC in Dark Souls 2, they feeled like random location without any story and clear objective, while DS1's dlc have a good story, bosses and characters. Right now I am playing DS3 , and this is much better than 2, especially visually it looks like technichal demo on Unreal Engine 5 :) I didn't expect that I can play something as beatifual as Dark Souls 3 on my computer. I will probably give a second chance for Dark Souls 2 sometime later, because for some reason I like rewinding things that I thought were bad a long time ago. \n\nI hope there are no major mistakes in my comment I don't know English that good, also this is likeley the biggest comment I have ever written, I really enjoyed your video.

It is very well made, and was enjoyable to watch.\n\nI didn't play Vanilla, so if someone wants to invalidate my point because of that, go ahead. However, judging solely by what I saw in this video, I think I wouldn't enjoy Vanilla as much as I enjoyed SotFS, and potentially why you enjoyed Sinner more.\n\nTo me personally, Dark Souls isn't about difficulty, death counts, ganks or anything like that. The most important part for me is experiences I get throughout my playthrough. Exploring a beautiful area, defeating a strong boss, finding a cool weapon and demolishing everyone with it, interacting with various NPCs -- all these things are major experiences that you will remember after finishing the game and maybe for much longer. However, minor experiences are as if not more important: they tie your playthrough together in a one complete journey and not just a collection of boss fights.\n\nAnd I can't help but feel that SotFS excels at it much more than Vanilla does. You mention how you found cool that there are soldiers who attack trees of giants. I feel like if they were not there I would just think its a regular tree without anything interesting to it. However, because they are there, they make me wonder. Why are they attacking the tree? Is it special? Are they trying to cut it down? Did someone command them to do it? Because of all of that I make a memory about this suspicious tree and, consequently, create a connection with the game.\n\nThe dragon guardians in the Dragon Aerie create a sense of importance to the place. They help to provide the feeling that you are reaching a climax of your journey (or at least an important point of it). If the place were empty, I probably would just easily forget about it.\n\nYou mention the red dragon in the Heide's Tower of Flame as an extra unnecessary enemy. I, however, remember him as a memorable challenge to overcome: you have to either avoid or defeat all enemies prior to him, and then fight off with most likely your first dragon in the game. After that, the Old Dragonslayer bossfight itself feels like a reward (especially if you played DS1 before). Also, it kind of answers the question why Dragonrider doesn't ride a dragon -- the dragon just chills nearby.\n\nSame goes for Heide Knights awakening after you defeat the Dragonrider, and many other different things -- they bring the world they inhabit to life. That is why I think I enjoyed DS2 as much as I did.\n\nAgain, I didn't play Vanilla myself, so I could just be completely wrong. Ultimately, I don't think the two versions are different enough for someone to argue that one is unarguably superior to the other. I would recommend SotFS to my friends simply because of better visuals.", "textOriginal": "First of all, thank you for this video! It is very well made, and was enjoyable to watch.\n\nI didn't play Vanilla, so if someone wants to invalidate my point because of that, go ahead. However, judging solely by what I saw in this video, I think I wouldn't enjoy Vanilla as much as I enjoyed SotFS, and potentially why you enjoyed Sinner more.\n\nTo me personally, Dark Souls isn't about difficulty, death counts, ganks or anything like that. The most important part for me is experiences I get throughout my playthrough. Exploring a beautiful area, defeating a strong boss, finding a cool weapon and demolishing everyone with it, interacting with various NPCs -- all these things are major experiences that you will remember after finishing the game and maybe for much longer. However, minor experiences are as if not more important: they tie your playthrough together in a one complete journey and not just a collection of boss fights.\n\nAnd I can't help but feel that SotFS excels at it much more than Vanilla does. You mention how you found cool that there are soldiers who attack trees of giants. I feel like if they were not there I would just think its a regular tree without anything interesting to it. However, because they are there, they make me wonder. Why are they attacking the tree? Is it special? Are they trying to cut it down? Did someone command them to do it? Because of all of that I make a memory about this suspicious tree and, consequently, create a connection with the game.\n\nThe dragon guardians in the Dragon Aerie create a sense of importance to the place. They help to provide the feeling that you are reaching a climax of your journey (or at least an important point of it). If the place were empty, I probably would just easily forget about it.\n\nYou mention the red dragon in the Heide's Tower of Flame as an extra unnecessary enemy. I, however, remember him as a memorable challenge to overcome: you have to either avoid or defeat all enemies prior to him, and then fight off with most likely your first dragon in the game. After that, the Old Dragonslayer bossfight itself feels like a reward (especially if you played DS1 before).
