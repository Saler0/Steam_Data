All these games were always cryptic and they wouldn't tell you a direct story rather than some random lore. Also, they wouldn't tell you enough things about the game mechanics. You had to firgure them out yourself or from item descriptions. You got cursed? Good. Maybe you saw that item that removes curse. Also for some light in the very dark skeleton tombs, there are 3 lights, one is the lantern, the other is another hat (which yes you have to find from opening the path to izalyth, so it's a quest-like non obvious thing) and third is to cast light spell. I prefer the hat because I just wear it and all my hands are free to have shield for example or two hand a weapon (two hand and max upgraded zweihander is great against the awfully aggressive and poise breaking big skeleton dogs). Spell is second best choice but of course it will wear off while exploring. Even in the New Londo ghost area the game gives you different ways to fight the ghosts. Few weapons are blessed and hit even without using the item that make you capable. But also if you get cursed from the lizards with half health, you can also hit the ghosts. And they also leave blade that is also effective. So many different unique ways they found to tackle these problems.\n\nRepairing is useless? It felt even more useless to me in DS3. I have repair powder and never for once weapons broke on DS3. At least in DS1 if you rest in a bonfire your weapons don't repair. So if you play for a long and forget to repair you might get in trouble. And maybe you didn't bought the repair box from the blacksmith so you would have to go back to blacksmith from blightown if you couldn't warp yet.\nOn DS2 everyone complained weapons broke so fast. But that's the only time it made the repair function sense, either with repair powder or repair spell or being conscious to carry more than one weapon so that they don't break mid fight. Of course it's DS2 that introduced the mechanic were resting on a bonfire immediately repairs your weapons. But when I was trying a no-bonfire run I realized how important repairing was in this game and how it made it more into a survival game which is great imho. I like more the dangers of traversing the enviroment, damagin your stuff, being out of estus, using the environment to help you, rather than fighting a boss for 50 times. There are different types of difficulty and I prefer the DS1/2 one.\n\n\n\n\nThere is this final point where you say there is a bad action input queue, where you attack more than you intended. Wait though. Recently I realized a reason I am always worse with DS3 in battle than DS1/2, besides the fact that everything is more aggressive and non stop compo in DS3. I was getting exactly the same. It feels like DS3 has worse of this \"action input queuing\" problem than any of the other souls games. I went back and try to intentionally press early attack or roll on DS1/2. It's still there but it's happening later, like middle of the previous attack animation. In DS3 it happens earlier. I have more times where I swing a weapon 3 times instead of 2, missing me the opportunity to get my stamina or do a roll instead. Like I am 1.5 on attack animation but because I mashed it there, before 2nd animation finishes, it does a 3rd attack. But right at 1.75 I realize the enemy is about to counter, so I should have rolled instead. And I press the roll before 2nd, but because I pressed the attack more than 2 times, it goes with an attack and I get hit. Or you panic roll and the 3rd roll is caught because the attack is delayed but you saw it before the 2nd roll even finished and stopped pressing but now it's too late because the action will happen. This Thing Is Worse on DS3. It was ok on DS1/2 and those games were slower and more methodical anyways so they didn't have you spam buttongs too frequently. DS3 is so insane aggressive and non stop combos that it has you button mashing and then punishing you for doing exact so. It's the BS why I thought I wasn't gitting gud with this game compared to the previous two and then realized it's not exactly my fault. It's strange that you mention input queuing and the exact problem of doing more than 2 attacks while you didn't intended, because that's exactly my problem with DS3 and it's less of a problem in my DS1/2 playthroughs.\n\nOther than that, coming from DS3 to the previous games of course some things will look outdated.

The first half of the game has an incredible level design and makes the player want to explore. It has a wide range of builds and weapons. Satisfying combat, boss variety, but there is one thing that draws the player into the world from the very beginning and binds them to it, the NPCs. This game has such a magic, it draws you in in such a way. At the very beginning of the game you see Solaire, shining like a sun in this dark and corrupt world. A little further on you see Andre the Blacksmith, reassuring, wishing you well, wanting you to be safe. And just a little further on, you see Onion Bro. From the very first moment, the Michelin Rubber Man gains your sympathy with his armor. Onion Bro Siegmeyer, who sleeps all the time, a cheerful, cheerful man who calls himself a pickle., accompanies you on your adventures and saves you a few times, but fights with you by shouting war cries when necessary. Yes, the second part of the game is incomplete in terms of level design, the bosses are weak, your desire to explore decreases, in general, the graphics are not a good game even for its period, but I am sure that everyone who plays the game remembers very clearly the first time he saw Anor Londo, remembers Ornstein and Smough very clearly, or if he could not save him, the moment Solaire attacked him, and if he could not save him, he remembers Siegmeyer's death in Lost Izalith very clearly.Artorias and Sif. The first time I fought Artorias I got through on like my 15th attempt and on my 14th attempt I let him kill me when ı was about to kill him, it was such a fun battle that I wanted to do it again. Fighting Sif' and her near-death limp, then entering the DLC area and rescuing baby Sif before fighting Manus. When I was fighting Kalameet, I never thought I could beat him, but the satisfaction I felt when I beat him was indescribable. These bosses weren't just hard, they were hard, fun to fight, and satisfying. And Manus. I recently finished Dark souls 3 and Bloodborne, including the DLCs, but none of the bosses pushed me as hard as Manus, I barely killed Manus on my 35th try. Orphan of Kos, Laurence, Luthwig or Midir, Sister Friede, Gael (which I think is the best boss and boss fight in the whole series) none of them pushed me as hard as Manus. Artorias made me want to learn the whole Dark Souls lore and became my favorite character in the whole series. And here comes the final boss Soul of Cinder Gwyn. After Manus, I expected the last boss to be very difficult, but the boss was easy, it could be killed in 4-5 moves, but there was something about that battle. While I was waiting for God Gwyn, I found him far away from his prime period, now collapsed and waiting for the new lord with a hope in that battle and of course plin plin plon. \r\nIf someone says that this is the best game in the series, I won't argue with them, so I definitely don't think this game is overrated. It was one of the most special gaming experiences I've ever had, and there are many more things I haven't written here. I finished this game about 6 months ago, by the way, I'm writing all this without any nostalgic attachment. Even writing this made me want to play it again, so 'Be safe friend. Don't you dare to go hollow'.", "textOriginal": "Definitely not the best soulsborne game, bloodborne and ds 3 are better games (I haven't played elden ring and ds2 and demon souls yet) but definitely the most special Fromsoftware game. The first half of the game has an incredible level design and makes the player want to explore. It has a wide range of builds and weapons. Satisfying combat, boss variety, but there is one thing that draws the player into the world from the very beginning and binds them to it, the NPCs. This game has such a magic, it draws you in in such a way. At the very beginning of the game you see Solaire, shining like a sun in this dark and corrupt world. A little further on you see Andre the Blacksmith, reassuring, wishing you well, wanting you to be safe. And just a little further on, you see Onion Bro. From the very first moment, the Michelin Rubber Man gains your sympathy with his armor. Onion Bro Siegmeyer, who sleeps all the time, a cheerful, cheerful man who calls himself a pickle., accompanies you on your adventures and saves you a few times, but fights with you by shouting war cries when necessary. Yes, the second part of the game is incomplete in terms of level design, the bosses are weak, your desire to explore decreases, in general, the graphics are not a good game even for its period, but I am sure that everyone who plays the game remembers very clearly the first time he saw Anor Londo, remembers Ornstein and Smough very clearly, or if he could not save him, the moment Solaire attacked him, and if he could not save him, he remembers Siegmeyer's death in Lost Izalith very clearly.Artorias and Sif. The first time I fought Artorias I got through on like my 15th attempt and on my 14th attempt I let him kill me when ı was about to kill him, it was such a fun battle that I wanted to do it again. Fighting Sif' and her near-death limp, then entering the DLC area and rescuing baby Sif before fighting Manus. When I was fighting Kalameet, I never thought I could beat him, but the satisfaction I felt when I beat him was indescribable. These bosses weren't just hard, they were hard, fun to fight, and satisfying. And Manus. I recently finished Dark souls 3 and Bloodborne, including the DLCs, but none of the bosses pushed me as hard as Manus, I barely killed Manus on my 35th try. Orphan of Kos, Laurence, Luthwig or Midir, Sister Friede, Gael (which I think is the best boss and boss fight in the whole series) none of them pushed me as hard as Manus.

Right after you arrive in Firelink, assuming you have the Master Key, there are 8 bosses you can choose to fight next. DS3 is much more linear, with you only having 2-3 options to progress. After Ornstein & Smough the game opens up again, giving you 5 new ways to go. The interconectivity and level design of DS make this level-based game feel like it's open world, an open world maze you gradually learn to traverse and use to your advantage. Given, you loose quite a bit of that freedom if you don't choose the Master Key as the starting gift.\n \n6:52 Why didn't you mention the whole twist about the illusion of Anor Londo, Kaathe, and the Chosen Undead narrative? You aren't portraying Dark Souls' very existing and intriguing story properly. It's like if I were to reduce DS3's story to \"you are an Unkindled, whatever that means, you have to beat the old Lords of Cinder because they don't feel like doing their job so you can link the fire and become a Lord of Cinder\". It's kinds ironic actually, the story of Dark Souls being portrayed as superficial and bland while the powers that be in the game are actively trying to fool you into believing the story is superficial and bland.\n\nLost Izalith isn't that bad if you ignore the dragon leg enemies, I mean that because \"the floor is lava\" is irrelevant since you take very little damage with the ring on, and the visuals are cool. But the area does suffer from rushed development and FromSoftware did admit it was unfinished. The same goes for the Bed of Chaos, which is probably the 2nd worse boss in the trilogy (1st to me would be the Darklurker from DS2 if we are also counting the runback).  \nCapra Demon is a bs fight, yes, but it's pushing you to learn the fundamentals. The Asylum Demon taught you to plunge attack and dodge, Taurus Demon reinforces that while also teaching you the importance to be aware of your surroundings (bc you can fall off the wall and there are two hollows shooting at you if you don't kill them before the fight), the Bell Gargoyles taught you that certain bosses have weakspots (tail weapon) and how to deal with more than one strong enemy at the same time, while also reinforcing spacial awareness and coordination. Capra Demon puts all that to the test, with you annoying but weak enemies that will to chip damage to you and interrupt your actions if you ignore them, and a big and strong but slow enemy that has some attacks that can be blocked and others that can't. You can use the unfair, small arena to your advantage in order to separate the dogs from him to kill them, and then make a plunge attack on Capra. Once the dogs are dead, he is very easy if you passed the skill check of beating both gargoyles at once. What you learn here is tested later against Ornstein and Smough, another combo of a fast and a slow enemy.  \n\nIf you beat the Gargoyles you aren't supposed to lash out at a difficult encounter because you know you can learn the patterns of everything the game throws at you. That is, unless you used an overpowered weapon to kill the first gargoyle before the second one could spawn, but then you can also kill the dogs in 1 hit and Capra in 3-4 hits (a +3-+5 Zweihander, for example). There is RNG, but the fight starts the same 90% of the time, with Capra doing the two-handed jump attack. Dodge, kill the dogs while he recovers, or run up the stairs and kill the dogs there. The fight is bs and one of the less interesting ones, yes, but it goes from unfair to easy if you take the time to observe, learn, strategize, and test what is the best approach, what works and what doesn't work so you can overcome a seemingly impossible challenge where the odds are against you. That's the whole point of Souls games, after all.  \nNever thought I would be defending the Capra Demon of all bosses. There is bs but it's not pointless nor is it the devs just trying to troll you and make you mad. A test of mettle, yea, it sure is.\n\n12:21 Hmm, so are you blaming the game because you didn't read Andre's catalogue of items he sells? Or the Undead Merchant's in Undead Burg? And I guess you also didn't remember he also sells repair powder at a low price?\nAnd you are talking like you have to do the \"chore\" of taking care of your equipment after each fight, while the weapons and armor take quite a bit of time to be \"at risk\", and they autorepair upon upgrading. You absolutely can go through the whole game without repairing your equipment but just uprading your main weapon/s. Unless you are using a weapon with low durability like a katana or a crystal weapon, or you get hit by the 2, maybe 3 attacks in the whole game that corrode your gear (I can only remember the Gaping Dragon's puke and the Burrowing Rockworms' spit).  \nAs for it being pointless, it's even more so in DS3 since there you have to actively try to break a weapon, because the durability takes a long time to decrease and it autorepair when you sit at a bonfire. DS2 on the other hand goes on the opposite direction, with most weapons having low durability, that decreases fast and they have more enemies with corrosive attacks, making it much more of a chore to either go back and rest or to stock up on repair powder.\n\nYes, the process of getting access to the DLC is very convoluted. But you can't compare that to the Painted World. Come on now, you find the doll when you go back to the asylum and the description tells you about a cold and lonely painted world, then you go to Anor Londo and see a big fucking painting (or remember you saw it if you grab the doll later). Besides, it's common videogame logic to explore the areas you are in. You see a painting at the end of the room, with loot close to it, being guarded by enemies? You go there. If you have the doll you can enter. If you grab the doll later you will remember the big painting you saw, so maybe you should go back there. Also, it is an optional area at the end of the day, it is meant to be secret. And it rewards you for exploring and paying attention to everything. \n\n14:40 Huh, do you know you can just play offline? Then you will only be invaded in some specific places by npcs if you're in Human form/Embered. It's a way for you to choose if you want to engage in pvp while playing online. If you want the benefits of being embered, for example, but don't want to deal with pvp, then play offline. Where is the problem here? And ds3 is even more forgiving (which I like) in that you have to be emberered to be invaded or to summon, but you don't need to in order to be summoned, either for pvp or co-op, but that is still your choice because you have to put your sign down or wear the covenant item. This also exists in DS1 but not to the same extend. You can be summoned as an invader even in hollow form if you are wearing the Cat Covenant Ring (and belong to that covenant). The games always give you the choice to engage or not in online play, you can't blame the game because you got invaded if you chose to play online. Although I agree that there is toxicity in the pvp, with people abusing overpowered/meta builds to get cheap wins.\n\n17:25 \"there are supposed to be 10 or more\". Again, you're working with wrong information here, either because you thought it should be the same number as in ds3 or because someone told you and they were wrong. You can get the Estus to a maximum of +7, but you don't really need that much healing, +5 to +6 being fine. Also, to get 2 of those 7 you have to be kinda heartless or at least have to answer moral dilemmas.\n\nIdk, I understand that the curse is a very punishing mechanic, but, having played ds1 first and then ds3, I found it kinda unremarkable in ds3. You don't fear getting cursed, it's just an insta kill inconvenience, like a really strong bleeding. In DS1 the curse has more weight to it, it feels more like... Well, a curse, something dreadful you definitely want to avoid.\n\nThe four-directional rolling does feel weird after having played ds3. But before that I never even noticed it. Just like the required souls to level up thing, and driking Estus while walking, or displaying the equip load percentage, those are quality of life improvements that were implemented later. You can't make a critique of a 8-bit game and complain about the graphics and about it being 2d. The later games have the advantage of having been developed after the original, so they had already tested the waters and had gained experience as to what features they should keep, remove, or improve. I wish you could climb ladders faster by pressing circle/B in DS like you can in DS2 and 3, but I also know the game came out in 2011 and they only came up with that feature later. They could have implemented those features in the remaster, but the discussion of whether they should or shouldn't have is a whole other can or worms. One of the few gameplay changes they made in the remaster was that curse no longer stacks and that you can use or give multiple items at once instead of having to do it one at a time. But changing those also changes the experience, and sometimes that's not what you want. I bet you can find people that were displeased that the curse doesn't stack in the remaster and they have their arguments to defend that position. I'm not one of those, but maybe because I never got cursed twice in the ps3 version (or can't recall it since it has been some time) and have mainly played the remastered version on pc anyway.", "textOriginal": "0:48 \"no controls are explained\".

But you can't compare that to the Painted World. Come on now, you find the doll when you go back to the asylum and the description tells you about a cold and lonely painted world, then you go to Anor Londo and see a big fucking painting (or remember you saw it if you grab the doll later). Besides, it's common videogame logic to explore the areas you are in. You see a painting at the end of the room, with loot close to it, being guarded by enemies? You go there. If you have the doll you can enter. If you grab the doll later you will remember the big painting you saw, so maybe you should go back there. Also, it is an optional area at the end of the day, it is meant to be secret. And it rewards you for exploring and paying attention to everything. \n\n14:40 Huh, do you know you can just play offline? Then you will only be invaded in some specific places by npcs if you're in Human form/Embered. It's a way for you to choose if you want to engage in pvp while playing online. If you want the benefits of being embered, for example, but don't want to deal with pvp, then play offline. Where is the problem here? And ds3 is even more forgiving (which I like) in that you have to be emberered to be invaded or to summon, but you don't need to in order to be summoned, either for pvp or co-op, but that is still your choice because you have to put your sign down or wear the covenant item. This also exists in DS1 but not to the same extend. You can be summoned as an invader even in hollow form if you are wearing the Cat Covenant Ring (and belong to that covenant). The games always give you the choice to engage or not in online play, you can't blame the game because you got invaded if you chose to play online. Although I agree that there is toxicity in the pvp, with people abusing overpowered/meta builds to get cheap wins.\n\n17:25 \"there are supposed to be 10 or more\". Again, you're working with wrong information here, either because you thought it should be the same number as in ds3 or because someone told you and they were wrong. You can get the Estus to a maximum of +7, but you don't really need that much healing, +5 to +6 being fine. Also, to get 2 of those 7 you have to be kinda heartless or at least have to answer moral dilemmas.\n\nIdk, I understand that the curse is a very punishing mechanic, but, having played ds1 first and then ds3, I found it kinda unremarkable in ds3. You don't fear getting cursed, it's just an insta kill inconvenience, like a really strong bleeding. In DS1 the curse has more weight to it, it feels more like... Well, a curse, something dreadful you definitely want to avoid.\n\nThe four-directional rolling does feel weird after having played ds3. But before that I never even noticed it. Just like the required souls to level up thing, and driking Estus while walking, or displaying the equip load percentage, those are quality of life improvements that were implemented later. You can't make a critique of a 8-bit game and complain about the graphics and about it being 2d. The later games have the advantage of having been developed after the original, so they had already tested the waters and had gained experience as to what features they should keep, remove, or improve. I wish you could climb ladders faster by pressing circle/B in DS like you can in DS2 and 3, but I also know the game came out in 2011 and they only came up with that feature later. They could have implemented those features in the remaster, but the discussion of whether they should or shouldn't have is a whole other can or worms. One of the few gameplay changes they made in the remaster was that curse no longer stacks and that you can use or give multiple items at once instead of having to do it one at a time. But changing those also changes the experience, and sometimes that's not what you want. I bet you can find people that were displeased that the curse doesn't stack in the remaster and they have their arguments to defend that position. I'm not one of those, but maybe because I never got cursed twice in the ps3 version (or can't recall it since it has been some time) and have mainly played the remastered version on pc anyway.", "authorDisplayName": "@giannixx", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/Cw7m-scGwuXpyV36FaETeZVzbSQoYfYvO-K7R-ushhO4mL825Zg6Q9bgpDcLgFTtbaKiBQzkcQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@giannixx", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCwePBdQxJKkoQOLx45XDdaA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 62, "publishedAt": "2024-06-27T00:13:00Z", "updatedAt": "2024-06-27T02:58:44Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 4, "isPublic": true}}

They are willing to hide entire areas with  a lot of content in them knowing that some players might never find them. Same with archdragon peak from ds3.
