{"text": "major takeaway from my most recent", "start": 224.72, "duration": 3.76}
{"text": "playthrough is that the game is pretty", "start": 226.4, "duration": 4.72}

{"text": "make sense that the most important part", "start": 241.84, "duration": 3.84}

{"text": "definitely in need of lots of love. But", "start": 332.72, "duration": 3.039}
{"text": "for me, the most important part about", "start": 334.4, "duration": 3.2}
{"text": "the update was the reworking of the", "start": 335.759, "duration": 3.44}
{"text": "character movements. And I do want to", "start": 337.6, "duration": 3.039}

{"text": "doesn't seem like there's a way to", "start": 360.32, "duration": 2.56}
{"text": "actually separate the two. So hopefully", "start": 361.36, "duration": 3.679}
