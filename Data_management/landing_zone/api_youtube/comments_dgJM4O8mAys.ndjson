Players just whine about how hard the game forcing devs to adjust to their level of skills instead of sucking it up and figuring out a strategy to beat every challenge.", "authorDisplayName": "@Rianme1ster", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_kcLZT-KDFt_0rvffQsEluw_Nnet-eUe5SnPCpR9J2SKLY=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@Rianme1ster", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCeXTAaFaqYJQtoPd2BL7kQw"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2025-05-01T03:11:29Z", "updatedAt": "2025-05-01T03:12:18Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}

Ran out to family video and rented it for 2 days. I was determined to beat it before my rental expired, and I did exactly that. At 23 hours and 25 minutes of game time, I finished Vanilla Dark Souls 2. I didn't even have internet on my xbox 360, so no patches. I explored every inch of it in that time, and honestly? I was pissed. I obviously missed something. So i saved up and bought a copy. Bought the dlcs one by one and downloaded them on a hard drive at my buddies place. I put at least over 1000+ hours into vanilla DS2 with dlc. Right before DS3 came out, I picked up SOTFS edition, and after hearing about how much better it was online, I prepared to play DS2 again. It was amazing being able to play the same game in a completely new light. Being able to again experience the journey of not knowing what was around every corner, where enemies were, or what items would be there. But that quickly wore off for me after my 10th gank death. Mind you, I completed the vanilla with no death, no bonfire, deprived builds with no leveling. And SOTFS feels unfair, everything about it from enemy placement to the FBOY artificial hurdles. SOTFS was made specifically to challenge veterans of vanilla to purposefully go \"oh you thought that you would go get the blue sentinels covenant for his miracles early? Screw you have a bunch of heide knights and a bloody dragon. \" it is the definition of what I would call artificial difficulty. The whole point of the almost 2x enemy spawns is to make you spend more time slogging through it, thus soft locking you until you either A. Kill all enemies in an area, at which point your healing items are gone, and weapons are broken. Or B. Learn the new enemy layout and just fucking run through everything. I hate playstyle B as it literally gives the player incentive to ignore entire parts of the game. In addition SOTFS enemy ganks lose a core experience of dark souls as a whole, which is the feeling of equal fights. Not of the battles themselves being equal, no but of the very concept that skillful play, good equipment, and accurate foresight can win you the day. In any of the souls games you can slowly approach every room, area, dungeon, boss or hazard and overcome it without feeling cheated when you die. Most of the deaths in DS and DS3 feel fair, oh I was poisoned, oh I was bled to death, dang that guys grapple was brutal and got me. But rarely do they feel like \"why the f*** are there 6 enemies in this small room that all have huge poise damage attacks that are incredibly large sweeps!?\" It feels cheap, and SOTFS has so many of these moments. It feels like a slog in almost every area to kill all the enemies, and rarely feels worth it. Vanilla ds2 will always hold a special place in my heart and SOTFS while refreshing as a sort of NewNew Game Plus, is genuinely far worse than the vanilla experience.\n10/10 video", "textOriginal": "I no lifed DS, so when DS2 came out, I was stoked.

All of these ambushes are visible and noticeable if you're patience or cautious.\n\nThe room after the smelter demon has falling trap doors that you can use to kill the enemies with the lava. Utilize it.\n\nShrine of Amana can be complete done no range weapon easily. I did it with a Santiers Spear +5 and a torch. Use the building to get close to some of the wizards to kill them. You can dodge the arrow by running to your left or right. I only died once attempting this and I usually complete this level by using a bow.\n\nI also did this with the default ADP of 9.

There are few of them, others are changed. Some iconic moments are lost. There are few other in SOTFS that can be a bit iconic in a different way. But now? They shouldn't have made a rerelease with different enemy placements. When I play either of the version, I don't remember what to expect at some areas, I am like \"I do remember here there was a crystal lizard, or a hidden enemy or a certain item, but where is it?\".

There are few of them, others are changed. Some iconic moments are lost. There are few other in SOTFS that can be a bit iconic in a different way. But now? They shouldn't have made a rerelease with different enemy placements. When I play either of the version, I don't remember what to expect at some areas, I am like \"I do remember here there was a crystal lizard, or a hidden enemy or a certain item, but where is it?\". As gaming will create memories around certain areas and items/enemies and traps you will encountered, those are very mixed for me when I play either version.\n\nBut yeah,. after finishing another time the SOTFS, I'll stick to the original when I replay.", "authorDisplayName": "@darkbugo7212", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/EJwOOst4zhkETLQ24ZqAw2vk6-XUy_Z8bnqo28V1wePQxsZ7Mqa9-vYSFWs9YGCgrPCYpJKZ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@darkbugo7212", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCWd0qopK8cEjUbqKbsXQSHw"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2024-02-24T10:03:48Z", "updatedAt": "2024-02-24T10:03:48Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}

Beating NG Scholar made me feel accomplished and victorious over a poorly designed game that took me 50 hours to perfect, but then NG+ removed the rush I had to make to get the remaining items due to adding new variables into areas and boss fights alongside higher hp values, stretching the amount of time I needed to beat the game an extra 20 hours, compared to DS1 where I only need 8 hours to do the remaining things I needed to do in NG+ and NG++ for all achievements.

Kill Lost Sinner, then go to Tseldora and just do it normally, you can rush from Majula to Quelaag poison clone without killing a single enemy.

Criticizing fromsoft for releasing a harder updated version is kind of silly. It’s kind of like complaining about master quest from Ocarina of time. It’s clearly weird, and not a good first way to play the game, but it was meant for die hard fans of the original that wanted a reason to go back and play it again.

I must say, I agree with some points. It doesn't feel as much as a world as DS1 did, just a collection of maps where you go through. Also the petrified statues are VERY annoying as well as some other elements. Overall I still like Scholar as it really has a great atmosphere nevertheless. I learned something through your video, though, what was bothering me and hadn't noticed before. 😄 I'm more a methodical player and clear an area before I proceed. Some areas are really tough, and now I know that is because there are much more multifights in Scholar than in DS1, and I usually try to avoid that. So I had a really hard time doing some bosses, because I have to learn to play without lock on and pay attention to multiple enemies at the same time.

In fact, I started to drop most of my armor for boss fights, in order to be more nimble, so I usually wear the armor only on regular play, but then mostly for the look, because I hate how my char looks like when only wearing this loincloth and I can't stay human long enough to bother with it. 😁", "textOriginal": "I never played DS2 and are currently playing Scholar. I must say, I agree with some points. It doesn't feel as much as a world as DS1 did, just a collection of maps where you go through. Also the petrified statues are VERY annoying as well as some other elements. Overall I still like Scholar as it really has a great atmosphere nevertheless. I learned something through your video, though, what was bothering me and hadn't noticed before. 😄 I'm more a methodical player and clear an area before I proceed. Some areas are really tough, and now I know that is because there are much more multifights in Scholar than in DS1, and I usually try to avoid that. So I had a really hard time doing some bosses, because I have to learn to play without lock on and pay attention to multiple enemies at the same time.

I finished Dark Souls 1, 3, and played a bit of Demon's Souls and a bit of Blood Borne before I gave Dark Souls 2 that final try and I'm really glad I did, because despite it's problems, it's my second favorite souls game (we'll see what happens when Blood Borne finally runs at 60fps and I play it for realzies, that might take 2's spot).

You are dead on the money when you talk about Playing Scholar first and Vanilla second. I even tried going back to scholar after playing vanilla, nope, it still sucks.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that Bandai refuses to put DS2 vanilla and its DLC on sale and third party key sites have been exhausted because there hasn't been that sale in years. The game has all the same content (the scholar boss was added via a later update and the weapon durability bug was fixed on both version) and fixes but 2 just runs and looks better (directx 11 support) and has the bigger online. But if you want to get Dark Souls 2 complete, vanilla edition, you either have to drop 50 dollars (25 for the game, 25 for the season pass) or pirate it. Really sucks. You should honestly get DS2 vanilla for free with scholar now.\n\nI'd also add that there's something just foul under the hood for DS2 Scholar.

My sword doesn't get through wall and his does!", "authorDisplayName": "@martinmakovsky7839", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_mzwk73fmnfDwFs4aca8l6kkQx6GyTAVAtENSyHlH_Zex_oOyaCVbcQl_w7mzDMX7MLRg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@martinmakovsky7839", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC3H3ay7z_bxOp5M2oHA4XwA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 1, "publishedAt": "2023-07-29T21:01:02Z", "updatedAt": "2023-07-29T21:01:02Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 1, "isPublic": true}}

You will get the same amount of iFrames regardless of how far you roll. 2 handing a weapon no longer gives you a straight damage increase, it now gives you a strength buff that may or may not increase your damage output based on how well your weapon scales.

Stop nerfing in your patches and fuckin' fix the game, or refrain from releasing a game until you fuckin' fix simple things like collisions....", "authorDisplayName": "@BillZebubproductions", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_nu4IyZJyqCtM0F9oMENo5sBS0bCIrEjtX5J1xjECfyDg=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@BillZebubproductions", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-RRhVGUJFhI47QDUA5pY2w"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2023-07-09T03:22:50Z", "updatedAt": "2023-07-09T03:22:50Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}

Switching targets on lock on with mouse is so painful it's natural to play m&b without lock on, on top of the mouse camera control being so much better it didn't even matter because lock on would just take away one of the few advantages a mouse gave you.\n\nGreat video, great review. I feel like a brainlet watching you and hearing you describe stuff that's seemingly obvious yet I couldn't reach the same conclusion without hearing you say it first.

I am not good at the game, most bosses took atleast 2 tries and also most of them took atleast 6 or 7 tries. Especially the dlc bosses. Ivory king took me like 4-5 hours cause of his fcking pre summon mechanic. But this game is teaching me to play extremely defensive and slow and i kinda like it. Also the branches of yore are actually a mechanic i like. It makes me remember spots to return to and most places you have to use the branches you get one back, atleast from what i remember. What i hate tho about DS2 in general is the amount of 2v1 or 3v1 boss figths, i enjoy 1v1 more as i dont have to focus on 2 or more bosses at once. Obviously more a skill issue but as a monster hunter veteran thats just more of my liking. The only 2v1 figth i enjoyed was the watcher duo. That figth felt fair.  And i mean i played the entirety so far with scythes (as soon as i could get my hands on one) and yes i leveled adp aswell as the other stats but i still struggle alot with the game, but i dont know if i would want to play an easier or more fair version after beating it instead of just replaying with the knowledge gathered of the first playthrough. Sry for the book i just wrote ^^", "textOriginal": "Man i am currently playing scholar,  and it just feels like they want you to kill the enemies on the boss runs considering their placements..  the red phantoms are downrigth annoying and probably my least favourite part. I am not good at the game, most bosses took atleast 2 tries and also most of them took atleast 6 or 7 tries. Especially the dlc bosses. Ivory king took me like 4-5 hours cause of his fcking pre summon mechanic. But this game is teaching me to play extremely defensive and slow and i kinda like it. Also the branches of yore are actually a mechanic i like. It makes me remember spots to return to and most places you have to use the branches you get one back, atleast from what i remember.

So? Good! DS1 had me running past enemies because I'd already beat them once, there was no point other than for souls, making the game easier for myself, to kill them. \nIn Scholar, I need to fight to explore safely, and that's a real reward. \nI respect your opinion but I can't agree on anything. \n\nEven the Heide Knights; they're no wear near on the same level as DS1's Dark Knights. They stagger easily, don't drop anything nice and half the time just swing wildly, side to side. They don't even have shields, which isn't an aesthetic comparison but more so that there's no tension to fighting them because you can attack freely. \n\nThe Dark Knights in DS1 weren't even that rewarding to fight; you could grab the loot they were protecting without engaging them, and they didn't drop anything useful unless you had the stats for it; The woods area of DS1, Darkroot Basin(?) where you could grab the shield that raises stamina faster, I didn't even see a knight was there. I grabbed the item, looked at it, equipped it, rolled around to compare the stamina regen, exited the menu and then walked on, and THEN the knight appeared. \"Oh, he was supposed to guarding that. Guess I'll just run away.\" - Yeah, really cool enemy. Better than the Heide Knights for sure, but I think you're purposely giving DS1/2 too much credit just to bash on SotFS.\n\nAround 6:40 you say the Heide Knights placement is equivalent to all the DS1 Dark Knights walking around one room in Anor Londo; One room? You mean one area, since Heide's Tower is an area not a room? Like the White Knights? The White Knights very similar to the Dark Knights? Purposely ignorant and exaggerating. \n\n7:14 How did you get one shot? You're over level 100, ON NEW GAME PLUS, or at least you've raised the NG area. Heide Knights don't drop that many souls or have that much health ordinarily. Again, you're exaggerating and just misleading the audience. You didn't even get one shot; you got hit three times in a row. Your HP is at the 75% cap but that's pretty ordinary, though I'd question why you're still using that ring in NG+ other than to perhaps purposefully get \"one shot\" for footage. \n\nYou even said something along the lines of \"Dark Souls 1 was a good game with a bad endgame\" - What a copout way of dismissing a huge letdown. Dark Souls 1 was great until the endgame, yes, but you can't just pretend the endgame isn't a part of it. That's like me saying \"SotFS is a great game with bad enemy placement\". No. It's a game, that has \"bad\", or at least questionable by the community, enemy placement, and that enemy placement affects the overall game, just like Lost Izalith makes DS1 worse. You can't pick on one game for one thing and then dismiss it in another game. \n\nYou're also purposefully treating the imaginary \"new player\" like an idiot. 6:21 - No, there is no forced 1v20; one, because there aren't 20 enemies that anyone would run past (There're 16 on screen from what I counted, and providing this is your footage you've gathered them on purpose just to exaggerate, which you do a lot, just pulling numbers from thin air) and two, these enemies are all downed when you see them. Yes, I've seen players get spooked by the enemies getting up off-screen, but not to an extent where they'd run around the entire tree gathering 16 of them before noticing, especially when you consider you have to stand still to pick up items, and players are likely to look up at the enemy throwing firebombs. The time spent standing still would give the enemies time to reach the player, who would then realise \"Oh, the enemies are coming from somewhere\", if they somehow before that saw no enemies get up on screen. Of course people will struggle with SotFS if they're the make-believe idiots you're inventing. \n\nAgain, I respect your opinion if you don't like SofFS, but dude, if you're gonna try justifying that opinion, at least try to base it on something real instead of just making stuff up for effect.

You are the third person to make this critique and I'm sick of hearing it. Dark Souls 2 is not unfun because people don't know how to turn off the lock-on feature.

DS2 is not a bad game ONLY for people who don't realize that clicking in the right stick while locked on can turn the lock-on off. I understand how the lock-on feature works, I turn it off sometimes, and other times I leave it on even when fighting groups. So does Jospeh Anderson, so does HbomberGuy, and so do you. There are way more enemy groups in Bloodborne, DS3, and Elden Ring, and yet people don't hate THOSE games like they hate DS2. And no, those games never have tutorials that explain that you can fight without lock-on. It's a moronic criticism, it makes ZERO sense, and you people need to stop using it. Nothing against you personally. I don't know anything about your content; I'm just sick of this bizarre insult disguised as criticism. You're literally saying \"Look, I'm sure it IS tough to like a game when you're stupid and don't realize this very basic aspect of the game, but if you knew how to play, you'd probably like the game more!\" Every FromSoft game after Dark Souls 2 has MORE group encounters and they NEVER teach you to lock off in those games, yet people had no complaints about groups in THOSE games. Come on. Use your noggin here.\n\nPeople don't hate DS2 because they lack basic critical thinking skills. They hate DS2 because there's no inspiration in the characters, the story, the lore, the levels, or the weapons. The animations in particular are painfully amateurish. Part of the appeal of DS1 was how realistic all the weapons felt, and then in DS2 most of the weapons are swung haphazardly with what feels like zero effort from the chosen undead, like he's lazily swinging around a limp noodle. It's laughable to imagine that half of the weapon swing animations would do any damage to the enemies with how weak they look. There's no feeling of progression, the enemy design sucks, none of the weapons look cool, and nothing that happens in the game makes any sense. THOSE are some of the reasons DS2 sucks. It's still a game with the souls mechanics, so it's still a solid 5.5/10 and I enjoy the simple act of running through the game and genociding the enemies, but it's not what I would call a GOOD game. And it would be a bad game even without the gank squads or increased reliance on annoying groups of enemies. ALSO, as MauLer pointed out in his novella on DS2, you can't just turn off the lock-on in every scenario. Using a rapier without lock-on makes it SUPER difficult to aim your attacks in an effective manner. Also, as one final point, it's not even remotely difficult to fight multiples while locked-on.

Now that i watch this video it definitely makes me wonder if the original is really that better!\nNice vid and i love the hollow knight music!\nMerry Christmas Everyone! :)", "authorDisplayName": "@jetlirlajqi6977", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_keUfTG27KsNIDlVLjXO-ji7j6RzlxnUKgs31pZ1BICzWM=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@jetlirlajqi6977", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UCLoC94gNmayk9Ow-vpPcmIQ"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-12-25T15:55:44Z", "updatedAt": "2022-12-25T15:59:56Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}

It has problems, sure. Every Dark Souls game has. But DS2 just has so many things done right and in many ways feels superior to the first game... to me.

Coming by a little late, as per usual with me, but here I am nonetheless. I am one of those. One of the weird ones. I played Dark Souls 2 before any other souls, and since that day I love it. Not because it introduced me to a genre of games I didn't know existed, nor because it has shaped my taste and my future now that I'm a game developer myself, and obviously not for introducing me to likeminded fellows that enjoyed similar games like me (totally not gods fkin no), but because it taught me patience, it taught me to look around and try to reasonably prepare myself for a fight before taking it on and fkin around and finding out. It taught me that for any sort of battle you must be as prepared as you can be and to, once in, make my best small bites at a time. I used to play this back in my pre PC days on my PS3, and I believe I sank over 500hrs into this game. currently here on steam I've barely surpassed 50hrs in SoTFs.\n\nFor me Dark Souls 2s spirit came mostly from its intent in making you prepare the arenas to your favour, into going around if a section seemed way too hard and making it less hard. As an easy example, you showed much that nasty section of Nadalia's Tower where u get mega ganked by immortal enemies until you break the fragment of Nadalia. Even once the fragment has been destroyed that battle is quite challenging if you take it head on. But there are this little scared bomb stick guys that run away from you around the upper sections of the level, that you can collect and add to the arena. Now some explosive enemies don't really make much sense when it comes to making the fight easier, but the big mace guys spews lava from one of his arms, lava that can detonate those little guys, meaning that if you time your entry properly with enough of this guys in the battle you can instantly whipe the entire gank just by pushing a little stick guy around. You could also use some of the grenadier guys above to indirectly blow up everyone by connecting with one of the little guys. And this is just one situation. \n\nNow ever since then, I've had the chance to play Dark Souls 1 and 3 and whilst I've come to adore the first one, I can't say so for the third. Now, I love Dark Souls 1 for what an amazing accomplishment it is, the amazing story it tells and definitely the rush of adrenaline you get when you have been about to be thrown down Anor Londo's Archway thingies by those pesky archers but you finally made it through (ehem... that last one sounded a little to personal ehmmm). In terms of three I like it mostly from the story part, and some of the lore, but shockingly nowhere near as 1 and 2. Hence my ranking for these three games its actually its release too, three being at the bottom, definitely thanks to the idea and term I've ended for it with being \"R1 Spam\".\n\nBut anyways, speech over, so back to topic. Thanks for giving Dark Souls 2 \"vanilla\" a chance, and thanks for sharing with us your changed thoughts on it (I share on most of them btw). This was the first ever video I've sen from you (I think) and I've been quite pleasantly surprised and \"touched\", so time to go down another channel's upload history again.

I'm not gonna go into the usual text-wall levels of explanation I tend to spit out when I disagree with someone, so apologies in advance if I make something unclear.\n\nI wanted to touch on the 1 mil soul skip and skelly dragon, but I see you already mentioned that in a comment.\n\nSo, I will focus on what I understand to be your main two issues with Dark Souls 2, or at least SotFS.\n\nFirstly, the simpler one. In regards to your complaints about Fragrant Branches of Yore and the statues they are used for - I believe you're using some really bad logic. I understand it, but I don't think it's in any way reasonable. Your main issue is, basically, not that people CAN softlock themselves, since that of course doesn't happen. So from what I understand, your issue is that the game makes it LOOK like you can softlock yourself. Which is certainly an issue, but not as big as you seem to believe. It's a pretty scary bit of miscommunication, but the only way this can become a serious problem is if you let it; in other words, this is only a big issue if you're dumb enough to believe a game dev would actually let you softlock yourself - and on top of that - in a \"better\" (as per marketing) version of the game.\n\nIf you see an obstacle and go \"hurr durr I guess the devs are dumb and they made me softlock myself, there sure ain't no OTHER way to progress, wah wah wah\" then you're just dumb. By the way, genuinely sorry if I'm coming off too strongly on the topic, but honestly ask yourself, do you actually think it's normal to blame the devs the moment you can't immediately see where you're supposed to progress? The \"fix\" to this issue can only be either the devs telling you \"Hey, if you can't get past this statue, there's another way!\" via Message, but that would be debatable (complaints of handholding), OR the hypothetical player I've been using up until now activating his brain and realizing \"Oh, well, there must be another way!\" Bottom line is, it's illogical to assume a respected and beloved developer would actually just fuck up so horribly and in such a brainless, dumb and easily fixable manner (if it actually was a way to softlock yourself, they would have patched the statue out.)\n\nAs for the second bit, that being \"enemy spam\"... Well as it turns out, counter to my assumption, this might actually be the one that takes shorter. Again, this might be an honest mistake, but to me the whole thing sounds like nothing more than skill issues, bar some of the TRULY shit enemy placements that you can only reliably survive when you actually know they're there. AKA, the shit ambushes. But as for the areas that just have a lot of enemies, and honestly even some of the ambushes (some are really easy to notice, like the Huntsman's Copse ambush you showed), I've genuinely never had any issue with them and am simply convinced you got yourself in trouble and are now blaming the dev. Your main point is that the number and aggro of the enemies is too extreme, leading you to getting used to running past them, which inevitably sets you up for failure. You argue that this is an issue from the very start and I disagree fiercely. Let's take the \"Pit of Hollows\"; the one bit in Forrest of Giants where you go up a ladder. Your argument for that part specifically, due mainly to it's shortness, is \"There's like 20 of them\" actually being said, while what's shown is them being aggroed, which leads to the inevitable conclusion that they're just waiting for you there, active right off the bat. This isn't the case, as anyone who played the game should know. All of the hollows, besides one that throws firebombs and the one at the second ladder, are inactive and laying down on the ground. The only immediately active enemies are three dogs, which are easy to deal with. After that, it's entirely easy to deal with the other hollows, even if you don't know about the one that throws bombs. You literally just walk up to one, kill it and move to the next one. The most that will aggro at once is two at a time and only in some cases. The only way to aggro all of them, subsequently screwing yourself over, is if you kite one around too much, get spotted by mr bombs, panic and run past all of the ones with their faces in the dirt, which I personally think is on the player, not the game, as I believe the enemy placement is clearly communicated and executed in a way that is easy to deal with, again, even if you're on a blind playthrough. And hell, if you screw yourself once by running past the enemies, surely the next time you decide to take your time, thereby dealing with them successfully and NOT getting in a dumb and illogical habit as running past all of them. The game isn't impossible, or even that hard to beat for you to NEED to run. I won't comment on why you might decide on running anyway, but it IS a dumb decision which I can't see anyone reasonable making.\n\nSo, what did we learn? Well, first of all, that I'm shit at guessing how long stuff takes. (Yes, I put this entire paragraph here just to make that joke.) But, jokes aside, I really don't think you thought this out too well. Personally, I find it better to talk to someone who has the opposite opinion first, before you make these videos. I'm not saying that because I think you're wrong, but because it can save you a lot of embarrassment in the future, IN CASE you happen to make a silly argument, like the bit where you genuinely said incorrect information about skelly dragon and the 1 mil souls skip. Basically, just have someone proofread your shit, but have it specifically be someone who disagrees, since those mfrs are gonna go through hell and high water to look for literally ANYTHING to disprove your point, while someone who agrees, obviously, is just gonna nod along the whole time and most likely not even pay attention when something OBJECTIVELY wrong (skelly, souls) sneaks in past all the SUBJECTIVE (enemies, statues) stuff you're gonna cover.", "textOriginal": "This feels...

The \"fix\" to this issue can only be either the devs telling you \"Hey, if you can't get past this statue, there's another way!\" via Message, but that would be debatable (complaints of handholding), OR the hypothetical player I've been using up until now activating his brain and realizing \"Oh, well, there must be another way!\" Bottom line is, it's illogical to assume a respected and beloved developer would actually just fuck up so horribly and in such a brainless, dumb and easily fixable manner (if it actually was a way to softlock yourself, they would have patched the statue out.)\n\nAs for the second bit, that being \"enemy spam\"... Well as it turns out, counter to my assumption, this might actually be the one that takes shorter. Again, this might be an honest mistake, but to me the whole thing sounds like nothing more than skill issues, bar some of the TRULY shit enemy placements that you can only reliably survive when you actually know they're there. AKA, the shit ambushes. But as for the areas that just have a lot of enemies, and honestly even some of the ambushes (some are really easy to notice, like the Huntsman's Copse ambush you showed), I've genuinely never had any issue with them and am simply convinced you got yourself in trouble and are now blaming the dev. Your main point is that the number and aggro of the enemies is too extreme, leading you to getting used to running past them, which inevitably sets you up for failure. You argue that this is an issue from the very start and I disagree fiercely. Let's take the \"Pit of Hollows\"; the one bit in Forrest of Giants where you go up a ladder. Your argument for that part specifically, due mainly to it's shortness, is \"There's like 20 of them\" actually being said, while what's shown is them being aggroed, which leads to the inevitable conclusion that they're just waiting for you there, active right off the bat. This isn't the case, as anyone who played the game should know. All of the hollows, besides one that throws firebombs and the one at the second ladder, are inactive and laying down on the ground. The only immediately active enemies are three dogs, which are easy to deal with. After that, it's entirely easy to deal with the other hollows, even if you don't know about the one that throws bombs. You literally just walk up to one, kill it and move to the next one. The most that will aggro at once is two at a time and only in some cases. The only way to aggro all of them, subsequently screwing yourself over, is if you kite one around too much, get spotted by mr bombs, panic and run past all of the ones with their faces in the dirt, which I personally think is on the player, not the game, as I believe the enemy placement is clearly communicated and executed in a way that is easy to deal with, again, even if you're on a blind playthrough. And hell, if you screw yourself once by running past the enemies, surely the next time you decide to take your time, thereby dealing with them successfully and NOT getting in a dumb and illogical habit as running past all of them. The game isn't impossible, or even that hard to beat for you to NEED to run. I won't comment on why you might decide on running anyway, but it IS a dumb decision which I can't see anyone reasonable making.\n\nSo, what did we learn? Well, first of all, that I'm shit at guessing how long stuff takes. (Yes, I put this entire paragraph here just to make that joke.) But, jokes aside, I really don't think you thought this out too well. Personally, I find it better to talk to someone who has the opposite opinion first, before you make these videos. I'm not saying that because I think you're wrong, but because it can save you a lot of embarrassment in the future, IN CASE you happen to make a silly argument, like the bit where you genuinely said incorrect information about skelly dragon and the 1 mil souls skip. Basically, just have someone proofread your shit, but have it specifically be someone who disagrees, since those mfrs are gonna go through hell and high water to look for literally ANYTHING to disprove your point, while someone who agrees, obviously, is just gonna nod along the whole time and most likely not even pay attention when something OBJECTIVELY wrong (skelly, souls) sneaks in past all the SUBJECTIVE (enemies, statues) stuff you're gonna cover.", "authorDisplayName": "@YTDariuS-my6dg", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/ytc/AIdro_l6j6Za-yqSQ2HxDwLsrjyehTa3RFEi78wehVQvTPo=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@YTDariuS-my6dg", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC-eH53OtjFWe33yunUhGxsA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 0, "publishedAt": "2022-09-06T13:39:30Z", "updatedAt": "2022-09-06T13:39:30Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 2, "isPublic": true}}

I'd say you're pretty correct that you're conditioned to fight and engage with the enemies in vanilla. There are less so it's easier to do. In SotFS, you can still fight through every single enemy until they all stop respawning. Because of how many more enemies there are in the rerelease however, that's obviously more difficult to do as the chances of dying or running out of Estus, your primary source of healing, is greater.\n\nIn vanilla DS2, I fought through every enemy encounter until they did stop spawning, and thus I was able to level a lot quicker. But even doing it in SotFS is viable. It's still possible, even though it tends to be more tedious. Regardless, I've always liked that DS2 has a somewhat compelling way of trying to make fights more challenging. First off, those life gems are plenty and the Estus shards to upgrade your flask are scattered all over the game. Combined with the ADP stat, you're forced to not only play slower, but play more tactfully and make the pressing decision of when to keep fighting and when to heal, and with what. The combat is slow, but it all culminates in a game that tries to force you to be more careful about every move you make.\n\nI'd never really considered SotFS to be any evolution of this, nor an overblown gambit to be more challenging outright. How one approaches the game, and how they interpret what the devs intended for the gameplay, can drastically change one's experience with it. Like I said, Scholar was the second version I picked up when I did finally get a PS4. But aside from the enemies and odd choices of those statues, it didn't really feel any different to me. SotFS is still DS2, even if it's more baffling than it has any right to be. That being said, I do agree that all the enemy placements, etc. could have been amended in the rerelease had it only been optional via the Covenant of Champions or new game plus. Again, I don't know why they did what they did to Scholar, but it being a rerelease, they had the chance to do whatever they wanted.

Then they saw people complain DS2 was too slow (while also praising BB for its speed) that when they made 3, they sped it up to match. And then people complained that DS3 was too fast for Souls combat and the combat felt like trying to play against BB enemies while not being as fast (which isn't valid whatsoever but you know, internet bitching), so ER slowed down a bit (and now people are complaining about combo strings being too long and not having enough openings to get safe damage in with slow weapons, so they ended up patching everything slower than a greatsword to be a bit faster and now we're back to DS3 speeds).\n\nThere's no winning, but FROM keeps trying.

Finished the game using the mace because it's busted, really enjoyed a good number of the boss fights, but didn't really want to jump back in. \n\nWhen I heard about Scholar and three different DLC's, I waited for the full release and all the patches that tend to come with a steam release, and when I jumped in I was delighted; way harder than the base game, better overall feel to the game, those statues encouraged a LOT more exploration (and thus I found a bunch of things I missed in the base game), and the DLC's were stellar, even if I found myself making silly mistakes with regards to the sometimes cramped geography. \n\nOverall, much prefer Scholar because I wanted the same challenge from DS1, and while it's not quite there, it's far closer than vanilla. I especially like the surprise enemy placements, especially the dragon in Heide's Tower of Flame, which required me to clear out enemies carefully, meticulously, before tacking the big guy and moving onto budget Ornstein.

I found Iron Keep much, much worse than Shrine of Amana. Shrine of Amana and Iron Keep are both awful for the same reason - you practically need to kill every enemy that aggros you or you're going to die before getting to the boss. With Iron Keep I think it's 15 knights you need to kill before reaching the boss. I remember being so pissed off that I counted them. Not only this but their aggro range is insane, there is no other enemy or set of enemies in DS2 that has the aggro range of these knights, they'll sprint to you from every corner of the castle so if you're not careful you can end up fighting 10 at once. You'll randomly get NPC invasions here too, which just adds insult to injury. Oh and there are also loads of archers on this level who stun you on hit, leaving you open to die to the swarms of knights and invaders. In my playthrough I ended up killing all of the knights the 12 times needed so that they don't spawn again, that was the only way I could make the runback to Smelter Demon bearable.\n\nShrine of Amana is also scummy but I think it feels better because of the distance you cover. It feels like you're making progress. Iron Keep is one small area so it feels like you're gaining inches. In Shrine the enemies are easier to fight and is a lot less taxing on resources than Iron Keep. You'll be murdered in both if you just run through, most of the time. Another thing I prefer about Shrine is that it's just a nice looking area with some good music, it's definitely easier to progress through, and you're fighting 3 varieties of enemies instead of literally just the same dude copy and pasted 15 times like in Iron Keep.\n\nI hate Iron Keep with an absolute passion and I felt degraded and insulted trying to get through the area. By killing most of the enemies to the point where they stopped respawning I just felt like I avoided the \"challenge\" while also wasting my own time.

And Scholar is better. In my opinion, it is the definitive edition of Dark Souls 2. You and I can agree to disagree I hope.\n\nDo not get me wrong. I 100% respect your opinion. I watched the entire video and I see your point. Additionally, you used Hollow Knight music, so extra respect there. I understand you prefer the original and why you do and I respect it totally. With that out of the way…\n\nFirstly, some things I agree with:\n\n- The removal of Heide Knights from basically everywhere and stuffing them all into Heide’s Tower of Flame was a negative change.\n\n- Iron Keep. That’s all.\n\n- I agree that the runs in the co-op content in the DLC are overtuned bullshit (however do not forget that they are optional and intended to played in co-op).\n\n- Hbomberguy’s DS2 video is plainly not all that great, regardless of his opinions on the game a lot of points he makes in his attempt to justify why he thinks DS2 is a better game than the first make zero sense or are just straight up wrong. I like Hbomberguy but this and his Bloodborne video are awful and you have every right to rip on them, because they suck.\n\nSome things I disagree with:\n\n- Vanilla Dark Souls 2’s enemy placements feel mostly random and strange and many levels feel unfinished. There are many areas in the vanilla Dark Souls 2 levels that feel barren of enemies and generally unfinished. \n\n- Archers in Scholar are mostly well placed and are overall a positive addition in my opinion. They add extra challenge and put a lot of pressure onto the player. They encourage you to tackle enemy encounters in different ways rather than just charging in there and killing all the enemies like you do the whole game in Vanilla. For example, luring enemies to cover where archers cannot hit you so you can fight them fairly. \n\n- The difficulty curve is fixed in Scholar (for the most part, because Iron Keep exists). In vanilla, the game is far too easy for the entire first half of the game and hardly increases in difficulty. Once you reach Drangleic Castle, the difficulty spike is enormous. However, the game then gets easier and easier until the end of the game which is piss easy by that point. In Scholar, the game starts off fair but not too easy or too challenging, and Drangleic Castle is harder than your average Lord soul path (emphasis on average, because Iron Keep) but isn’t a gigantic difficulty spike like in the original. The game then peaks in difficulty at the endgame in Shrine of Amana and the Giant Memories, like these types of games should, which is unlike the original where the game just gets easier from Shrine of Amana to Aldia’s Keep to Dragon Shrine to the Giant Memories. \n\n- Dark Souls 1 is indeed infinitely better than both versions of its sequel, but the diversity of the locations in Dark Souls 2 is part of what makes the game unique when compared to the other Fromsoft titles. There are countless breathtaking shots and locales in Dark Souls 2 and it has its own unique feel from 1 with its colorful pallet, in direct contrast to Dark Souls 3 which is all drab and gray and the locations are mostly your standard dark fantasy RPG (I do not prefer DS2 to 3, and the drab colors of DS3 is by no means a bad thing, I am just using it for comparison to DS2). In DS2, you go from Forest of Fallen Giants to Heide’s Tower of Flame to No Mans Wharf to Lost Bastille, all visually distinct, interesting and unique. In DS3, you go from boring cemetery to boring castle wall to boring Bloodborne village to boring forest to boring swamp to boring cemetery, and the locations don’t get interesting and unique until the Cathedral, Smouldering Lake and Irithyll. The diversity and unpredictabliltiy of the locations in DS2 is part of what makes the game special and gives it its own identity. I personally love this about DS2 but you are free to disagree. (Note: this is in response to what you said about the DS2 locations and is not a comment on your comparison between DS1 and 2, since I mostly agree with that)\n\nOne thing I REALLY disagree with: \n\n- Scholar is by no means a cash grab. Vanilla was broken and unfinished and Scholar fixed it. Enemy placements make more sense and the game is a big visual improvement. The game is also the same price as the vanilla but has all the DLC included.\n\nAnd, now for the obvious:\n\n- Skill issue. You have a skill issue. You approached every fight with a basic mindset and called bullshit when you saw yourself getting ganked by a dozen enemies while an archer shoots at you without thinking about what you could do to give yourself the advantage. You then lost your patience and ran through the rest of the game, including the DLC, because you had a skill issue and couldn’t be bothered with the game. The DLC is not better in vanilla, nor is it better in Scholar, because they are exactly the same. You getting mad at the game and losing your motivation to play it thus running past the DLC is a result of your own incompetence and skill issue. DS2 is not the same game as DS1 and 3. You were not taught to run past enemies by Scholar. You taught that to yourself because you grew impatient and dismissed every enemy encounter you felt was unfair as bullshit and ran past it. Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin is a very fun game when you approach it with the right mindset. \n\nSome things you said that are objectively wrong or invalid:\n\n- You do not need to fight Ancient Dragon to fight Aldia. Also Vendrick is indeed awful but even with 1 giant soul missing he still does not take that long to kill.\n\n- The petrified statue that blocks a path to the ‘cool dragon level’ does not have to be broken. You can take an alternate path to access the level.\n\n- The changes to enemy placement in Scholar are not as simple as ‘minus enemies in mid game to make that easier and massive surplus of enemies everywhere else’.\n\n- The skeleton dragon in Aldia’s Keep does still come to life, you just have to do some stuff in the area beforehand now.\n\nAnd lastly for the even more obvious, Scholar is a big graphical improvement and runs at twice the frame rate, can’t forget to mention that. \n\nIn conclusion, Scholar of the First Sin doesn’t change things in ways that make no sense, it changes things in ways that do make sense, and that’s where you and I can (hopefullly) agree to disagree.", "textOriginal": "I have played Scholar and the original.

The game then peaks in difficulty at the endgame in Shrine of Amana and the Giant Memories, like these types of games should, which is unlike the original where the game just gets easier from Shrine of Amana to Aldia’s Keep to Dragon Shrine to the Giant Memories. \n\n- Dark Souls 1 is indeed infinitely better than both versions of its sequel, but the diversity of the locations in Dark Souls 2 is part of what makes the game unique when compared to the other Fromsoft titles. There are countless breathtaking shots and locales in Dark Souls 2 and it has its own unique feel from 1 with its colorful pallet, in direct contrast to Dark Souls 3 which is all drab and gray and the locations are mostly your standard dark fantasy RPG (I do not prefer DS2 to 3, and the drab colors of DS3 is by no means a bad thing, I am just using it for comparison to DS2). In DS2, you go from Forest of Fallen Giants to Heide’s Tower of Flame to No Mans Wharf to Lost Bastille, all visually distinct, interesting and unique. In DS3, you go from boring cemetery to boring castle wall to boring Bloodborne village to boring forest to boring swamp to boring cemetery, and the locations don’t get interesting and unique until the Cathedral, Smouldering Lake and Irithyll. The diversity and unpredictabliltiy of the locations in DS2 is part of what makes the game special and gives it its own identity. I personally love this about DS2 but you are free to disagree. (Note: this is in response to what you said about the DS2 locations and is not a comment on your comparison between DS1 and 2, since I mostly agree with that)\n\nOne thing I REALLY disagree with: \n\n- Scholar is by no means a cash grab. Vanilla was broken and unfinished and Scholar fixed it. Enemy placements make more sense and the game is a big visual improvement. The game is also the same price as the vanilla but has all the DLC included.\n\nAnd, now for the obvious:\n\n- Skill issue. You have a skill issue. You approached every fight with a basic mindset and called bullshit when you saw yourself getting ganked by a dozen enemies while an archer shoots at you without thinking about what you could do to give yourself the advantage. You then lost your patience and ran through the rest of the game, including the DLC, because you had a skill issue and couldn’t be bothered with the game. The DLC is not better in vanilla, nor is it better in Scholar, because they are exactly the same. You getting mad at the game and losing your motivation to play it thus running past the DLC is a result of your own incompetence and skill issue. DS2 is not the same game as DS1 and 3. You were not taught to run past enemies by Scholar. You taught that to yourself because you grew impatient and dismissed every enemy encounter you felt was unfair as bullshit and ran past it. Dark Souls 2 Scholar of the First Sin is a very fun game when you approach it with the right mindset. \n\nSome things you said that are objectively wrong or invalid:\n\n- You do not need to fight Ancient Dragon to fight Aldia. Also Vendrick is indeed awful but even with 1 giant soul missing he still does not take that long to kill.\n\n- The petrified statue that blocks a path to the ‘cool dragon level’ does not have to be broken. You can take an alternate path to access the level.\n\n- The changes to enemy placement in Scholar are not as simple as ‘minus enemies in mid game to make that easier and massive surplus of enemies everywhere else’.\n\n- The skeleton dragon in Aldia’s Keep does still come to life, you just have to do some stuff in the area beforehand now.\n\nAnd lastly for the even more obvious, Scholar is a big graphical improvement and runs at twice the frame rate, can’t forget to mention that. \n\nIn conclusion, Scholar of the First Sin doesn’t change things in ways that make no sense, it changes things in ways that do make sense, and that’s where you and I can (hopefullly) agree to disagree.", "authorDisplayName": "@anonymous01201", "authorProfileImageUrl": "https://yt3.ggpht.com/sFw9Hcich6N68YOLVig5jDQzRHHDZmAhJRgZZPgTXEkbJiyVYUs83ELQ8v2NDuyiCU6cQNiWgQ=s48-c-k-c0x00ffffff-no-rj", "authorChannelUrl": "http://www.youtube.com/@anonymous01201", "authorChannelId": {"value": "UC9RyNSaamY3kYDy6jQpNLKA"}, "canRate": true, "viewerRating": "none", "likeCount": 4, "publishedAt": "2022-08-28T21:33:55Z", "updatedAt": "2022-08-30T04:11:50Z"}}, "canReply": true, "totalReplyCount": 0, "isPublic": true}}

The only area I believe your critique may be skewed is when you talk about enemy placement in scholar feeding a negative feedback loop. I dont think the intention of FromSoft (or any developer) is to create content with the hopes of you running by it blindly. I just finished a 100 hour playthrough of SOTFS and will admit, it was definitely more challenging than vanilla, but it did not feel intentionally unfair.

Playing Scholar , finally,  simple reinforced my thoughts about it , after having watched it streamed many times. Vanilla is the superior single-player first playthrough experience.  Vanilla gives you a great balance between exploration and combat. \n\nScholar is better suited as a co-op experience. Scholar wants to fill all your holes. Pretty much every area Vanilla leaves open for exploration, Scholar adds enemies there. It should be noted that Scholar lets there be 3 summons, instead of Vanilla’s 2. \n\nSomething worth mentioning is how very different item placement is. Vanilla has a much more difficult item placement. The Dull Ember is in Iron Keep. The Bastille key is after Gargoyles. Uber weapons  like Grand Lance, Staff of Wisdom, or Dragons Tooth, are very late game. Many armor sets were very difficult to obtain in Vanilla, like The Armor of Aurous, Warlocks Mask, and Heides set. \n\nA couple notes. I use lock on. Works great. Not sure why there’s been a recurring emphasis in these videos that no lock on is necessary. \n\nLifegems are not a band aid. Another recurring complaint. They’re the grasses, from Demons Souls. There’s a ton of Demons DNA in DS2. Like reducing max hp after dying. Lifegems are a functionally different way of healing. And serve to compliment the way Estus works differently.  In combat, do you stay mobile, and get a small, slow heal, or plant yourself for a big chug? \n\nI frames tied to a stat is functionally no different than tied to a roll type, except for naked pro players. And it’s more interesting, bc not every game starts with access to the best roll, before even taking a step, by getting naked. \n\nHit boxes are fine. Level iframes, and they’re no worse than other souls. Players are confusing what looks like a fast roll and should have iframes, but doesn’t, as a bad hitbox. Level iframes, and you’ll roll just fine. \n\nBosses should be judged against other souls bosses after ng+, at least. To understand why, you need to understand how Bonfire Ascetics work. Basically, the devs wanted to encourage players to use this genius new consumable. To do so, they didn’t act like other souls, and make the bosses give you all you can handle. If they made them too tough, players would never use a incredibly powerful and fun item. From my experience, bosses in ng+ use more rare attacks, punish healing and ranged better, and more follow up swings on combos. You can definitely see the AI stepping up its game. But if it was like that during the first try, far fewer players would interact with the game using Bonfire ascetics. \n\nDS1 has a great map before Anor Londo. A masterpiece. No other game compares. But from Anor Londo on, nothing special. I’m sick and tired of hearing how great DS1’s map is, bc only a portion is. DS2’s map is Demons Souls inspired. A hub, with spokes. Fun fact- you can walk everywhere, except to Lost Bastille, in DS2. \n\nNot every weapon has a guaranteed combo. You’ll have to react to the times when the enemy is out of range for the second hit. Like the Mace, sometimes you need to do the heavy instead of the second light, bc the enemy was pushed back. If a true combo weapon is that goddamn important to you, pick something else that does that. There’s plenty to choose from. \n\n\nStory is a personal thing. Both games have their merits, narrative-wise. Personally, i like the agency DS2 gives the player, to make a decision, instead of a pawn in the lord’s power-struggle. \n\nOne thing I feel like mentioning is that I never cared to replay DS1 in ng+. Not once. But i have multiple high ng+ cycles characters in DS2. The game makes real changes to the world, not just in ng+, but for every one of the next 6 cycles. Plus, you can reallocate levels, and try new builds, or weapons. DS1 felt suffocating in that way. Want to be a Wizard after awhile, but have been a big bonk build? In DS1, that means start over. \n\nDS2’s PvP and invasions are the best in the series. DS1 requires a PhD in glitches, and DS3 is roll-spam wars of attrition. DS2 is the sweetspot. That alone is going to keep DS2 forever in the limelight. \n\n\n\nIs DS2 perfect? Hardly.", "textOriginal": "I exclusively played Vanilla, from 2015-22. Played it all the time.
