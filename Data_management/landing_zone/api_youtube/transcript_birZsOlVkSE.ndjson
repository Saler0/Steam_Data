{"text": "the most part, I think they were really", "start": 350.56, "duration": 3.68}
{"text": "well done. Like the exploration was a", "start": 352.08, "duration": 4.16}
{"text": "key consideration for me. I felt like it", "start": 354.24, "duration": 4.0}
{"text": "was based on the demo, it was kind of", "start": 356.24, "duration": 3.92}
