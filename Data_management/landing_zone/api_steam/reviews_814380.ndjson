I've given up many times, but something in my heart tells me I have to finish the game. Not to get all the achievements, but just to finish the game. \n\nSo I tried, tried and tried. I wasted many hours on the same boss. When I reached the final boss (even though I had skipped Owl (Father)), I had a difficult time. \nThe final boss reads my inputs and kills me every single time. \n\nSo I did what they call a pro-gamer move: I just installed the \"Sekiro The Easy\" mod. \nAND BOY OH BOY! THIS MOD IS TOO POWERFUL!!! It only took me two minutes to beat the boss. XD (I wish I had found out about this mod earlier. T_T)\nI would still recommend playing the game without mods. I didn't use any mods before the final boss fight and I had one boss fight that took me 3 hours (I'm looking at you, Great Shinobi Owl).\nIf you just want to experience the story mode, you should use the mod I mentioned. \n\n(I wish FromSoftware had included an easy or story difficulty mode so blockheads like me could enjoy the game without getting stuck on the same boss for several hours.)\n\nI don't know if I ever want to play a Souls-like game again, since I'm so bad at that genre. It's also very time consuming and I still have a lot of games in my backlog that I need to finish.\n\nOverall:\nAnyway, I'm glad this game is available on PC.

I noped out at Genichiro, three phase boss fights are a no from me dawg. The fight isn't particularly hard, it's just an endurance test and if you mess up a few times you'll use up your resources before the final phase. \n\nIs it a skill issue? yeah. The problem is the failed attempts aren't fun and there is nothing new to learn with each retry. Once you know their moveset it's just retrying over and over until you hit the timings perfectly.

Its still objectively bad. \n\nDiscplaimer: Im very early on in the game (and Im waiting on a refund), so Im literally just at the 2nd boss - the chained big guy.  From what I can read - but not evaluate in the context of this review - my point about parrying not even being neccessary below would change later on, but I dont know that. \n\nSo let me describe the actual gameplay, vs what you are actually supposed to do with parrying: \n\nWhat you are supposed to do: \nParry attacks from enemies... because otherwise you get fucked. \nLet me make it more clear: Parrying isnt satisfying or per se good (let me explain below), its just that doing something else gets you fucked because of hitboxes. \n\nHow the actual gameplay makes you want to play (again, before and including the chained Ogre Boss):\nNormal enemies: Spam attack while isolating them one by one. \nBosses:  Either dont need to parry (ill explain) or you cant (I dont really see what attacks I can parry with the Ogre boss)\n\nWhy am I saying this? And what exactly am I saying:\n1) Parrying is stupid\n2) Parrying isnt needed, \n3) Except you are kind of forced to...\n\n1) With what I have seen so far, every time in terms of actual gameplay is literally punishing you for parrying:\nIf I parry an attack from an enemy, my bar fills up, which is bad. Im am literally punished for parrying. So I am literally incentivised to dodge, walk back or to the side or jump up/away. I cannot see (before the chained Ogre boss) any circumstance where parrying would actually help me. \nIn fact im confuse entirely about why its even in the game: I can literally just hold the parry button nd dont take any damage, and I never need to release it, because I dont have stamina that stops me from doing so. In fact - from readng discussions on it - doing this, literally recovers your own bar faster. \n\nYet somehow parrying is supposed to be the entire \"thing\" of the game? \"You are dancing the with the enemies, not fighting them enymore once you master it\" or \"Its like music, you have to get the rythm down\"\nI dont see it. Like at all. \n- Im punished for parrying by having my own bar fill up\n- And i literally can just hold the parry button pressed and Im invinceible until I see a red sign and jump away,  which I do anyway, because parrying is literally bad for me in terms of gameplay\n\nNow this applies definitely - and I would argue objectively - to normal enemies, and mostly to bosses. \nHence point 2) Parrying is quite literally not needed. Not at all for normal enemies and only slightly (so far) for bosses. \n\nI literally tried this out before the ogre boss. There are the 2 Samurai at the fire. So i killed the first/weak one and then death after death at the ogre boss i just spammed attacks on him without enything else. 100% of the time (like 10 times) he just died and had no counter at all. Even the times when he hit a perfect parry himself (spraky red parry - I assume thats a perfect parry?) literally nothing happened to me and I just kept on spaming attack... because there is literally nothing stopping me. \n\nSome other enemies sometimes have the red attacks that you need to dodge... except you can more often than not just keep spammming attack to interrupt them from doing it. There is third point here  (4) but Ill explain that later. \nThis even works on bosses sometimes and if timed right ( = mostly by accident). \n\nAbove I wrote: \n3) (Parrying isnt needed,) Except you are kind of forced to...\n\nwhy do I write this: because before the Ogre boss, there is a small boss that y+ou have to slice up 2 times. With that boss, you at least CAN parry - which I cant say about the ogre. And since it was the first real boss i experimented with it a bit. So yeah you can parry... but with his one you still did absoluetly not need to. But you can. \n\nExcept sometimes you are forced to. Its not just an option, but you actually need to. (Im sure if you are a dark Souls speedrunner you ca get over rthis, I wasnt in my 2 hours)\nThe reason is because the hit boxes often are insane, so dodging is impossible. \n\nThis is also tied to point 4, so lts go over it: \n4) What the hell do you do with those red attacks?\nIn the tutorial it says that you can - and thats my understanding of it - either jump or dash away from the attack thats not able to be parried. Except both for those \"red\" attacks but also normal attacks, it often does not work because of the hitbox and a mechanic the bosses have. \nA) Hitboxes: I dont know how many times I for sure dodged an attack or saw the attack go over my head yet I still got hit. Sure Dark Souls (3) isnt perfect here either, but comapred to this its a holy grail of hitbox accuracy\nB) From what I can tell, bosses can and do use the same mechanic as a player with focusing on the player with that dot you can focus on the boss too. I came to that conclusion when the ogre boss attacked me by jumping so that he could double kick me in face for a massive hit, and I dodged most of the time, for him to just rotate to me when I dodged to the side. So he literally rotated in the Air to give it to me. \n\nNow after looking into some discussions I realized that apprently there are swing attack, that you need to JUMP over, but there are also thrust attacks the you need to dodge to the side (like speer pokes). Guess what: They both use the same red symbol and you also cant really tell them apart perfectly. \n\nThis was so bad for me, that at the ogre I tried a few rounds (thats when I also tested the stronger samurai) of just dodging by jumping and just dodging by dashing. There I realized how f'd the htboxes are with me jumping up or to the side for his grab attack (when he jumps, not just grabs in front of him) yet even though I was outside of it, I clipped back into his loving arms. \n\n\n5) Last main point for the review: I hate when games queue up attacks as if you cant react to it. Its such a stupid thing. It does not feel good (Not in Dark Souls and not here - havent tried Elden Ring yet) and its so goddamn annoying. I mean try this: Throw a ball, exceptin the middle of throwing it stop. \"OMG THATS ANYMOATION CANCELIING AN BLABLABLABLABLA\". B*itch shut up. Why the hell do develepers literally have to stop me from reacting to make a game harded. I reacted, let me control my character. \n\nI hate this and I cant understand why on earth its so har for even From Soft to let go of this relic of who knows when what and where. If I react, let me react MF'er, and its more realisitc. It jsut sad if you need to do this to make it harded. Am i so strong as a player taht you need to articially stop me from dodging/parrying/blocking compared to your bosses?\n\nJust stop with this trope, please. \n\n----\nI can still get why people may like the game, but I objctively think the gameplay is contradictory in its nature and within the gameplay sets the wrong incentives compared for what you actually are supposed to do. From what I read parrying actually becomes neccessary and fun (\"Dacne\" and \"rythm\") later on, but I decided to get my money back before I get there, because I have so many other problems than even listed above. \n\nFor highlights of the rest of my complaints:\n- Why am I on the ground even if my parry bar isnt filled up?\n- Why do I have to watch some stupid animation everytime I die and want to reawaken? ( Is literally any moment in the entire game where you dont want to use it?)\n- I never had it once my parry bar was full that I actually got attacked and lost one of my red points. I just spammed jump and jmped away before the enemy as able to do anything....  so again: What the hell is the parry bar there for?\n- Why are the bosses so much bigger than me? Even If I parry im s far away from being able to attack, that I need to first run back to them, espcaially once they step back a bit themselves after I parry. \nCant write mo", "timestamp_created": 1749664481, "timestamp_updated": 1749664481, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.331858396530151367", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Gameplay\n\t•\tPrecise, smooth and, rewarding\n\t•\tChallenging gameplay that rewards the player for being attentive to the enemy\n\t•\tFromSoft decided to give the player no choice in character building, and very limited options in character leveling which some might not enjoy if they are fans of the previous entires. Although I found this off-putting at first I can’t deny that it just makes sense. You can't just over level your way through this entry you got to learn and improve, if you want to get through this game. \n\n2. Graphics & Art Style\n\t•\tThe game’s visuals beautifully capture the atmosphere of Sengoku-era Japan, with lush environments and striking character designs.\n\t•\tGraphics hold up very well, although I could have appreciated if the game wasn't locked in at 60fps \n\n3. Sound & Music\n\t•\tYou will be addicted to listening to the sound the deflect makes when you hit it perfectly\n\t•\tThe soundtrack enhances the experience when entering a boss fight or just navigating through areas\n\n4. Story & Writing\n\t•\tFirst play through I didn't get much of the story as it took the backseat while I focused on not dying around every corner\n\t•\tSecond play through I got to pay a bit more attention and really enjoy the story that at times can feel hidden but still interesting. \n        •\tI love that there are several endings kept me coming back\n\n5. Performance & Stability\n\t•\tMinimal to no bugs, with stable 60fps throughout my entire playtime\n\n6. Replayability & Content\n        •\tAs mentioned before there are several endings which kept me coming back but recently the devs have added new modes. You can now replay boss fights as I recall if you beat the challenging gauntlet modes you unlock cosmetics\n\n7. Value for Money\n\t•\tThe game to me is worth the $60 but frequently goes on sale making it super worth the money\n\t•\tNO MICROTRANSACTIONS\n\nPositives\n\t•\tGreat challenge, great atmosphere\nNegatives\n\t•\tlocked in at 60fps\n\t•\tNot personally a negative for me but it might be for some, there is no multiplayer, and it's so challenging that it can feel frustrating at times. (get gud)\n\nWould you recommend this game?\n\t•\tYes\n\t\nAdditional Comments\nYou'll die more than twice...", "timestamp_created": 1749568655, "timestamp_updated": 1749571038, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}
