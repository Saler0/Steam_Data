I’d heard the buzz—“Pinocchio Soulslike”? Say less, I’m in.\r\n\r\nFrom the very first hour, I was hooked. The combat is tight, the art direction is stunning, and the atmosphere captures that eerie, depressing tone that Souls fans live for. This isn’t just a solid attempt at the genre—it’s a masterclass. Lies of P doesn’t just pay homage to FromSoftware’s legacy; it earns its place beside it.\r\n\r\nAnd no, that’s not an exaggeration. This game is absolute perfection.\r\n\r\nWhat I Loved\r\n\r\nCombat That *Sounds* And *Feels* Right\r\nCombat is heavy, responsive, brutal—everything you want from a Soulslike. The guard is perfectly satisfying, and weapon assembly (blades and handles mixed together) provides all the build options. It's not for novelty's sake—it *works*.\r\n\r\nAtmosphere & World Building\r\nThis game has the most perfect grim fairytale vibe. It seems and feels like *Bloodborne* and *Sekiro* had a baby—a silly yet twisted, torn European city overtaken by puppet monsters, and filth surrounds you with Victorian horrors at every corner. Every square inch feels hand-rendered.\r\n\r\nStory & Lore\r\nIt's unexpectedly emotional. Without spoilers, the things that *Lies of P* does to talk about the morals of lying, who we are and want to be, and what essentially makes us human is a compelling experience. I never knew Pinocchio could be so dark, so sad—or so badass.\r\n\r\nBosses\r\nThese are Souls bosses and they're hard. They're creative and hard; some got me so frustrated I was ready to quit...until I achieved the victory I so deserved. So much dopamine.\r\n\r\nLies of P doesn’t just imitate the Souls formula it refines it in ways that feel fresh without losing what makes the genre so addictive. From its beautifully twisted world to its masterful combat and haunting narrative, it’s clear the developers poured their heart into this project. What started as a curious concept Pinocchio in a Soulslike turned out to be one of the best games I’ve played in recent years.\r\n\r\nIf you’re on the fence: don’t be. Lies of P deserves your time, your rage, and your eventual triumph. It's not just a great Soulslike it's a Masterpiece of a game, period.", "timestamp_created": 1749868072, "timestamp_updated": 1749868533, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Every book, note, and piece of lore you find adds layers to the world. I found myself reading everything, trying to piece it all together—and loving every minute of it.\r\n\r\nGameplay is straightforward and responsive. It’s easy to pick up, but there’s plenty of depth for those who enjoy mastering mechanics and perfecting timing.\r\n\r\nThe weapon system is a standout. There’s a wide selection to choose from, and every weapon feels different, with its own moveset and playstyle. You’re free to use whatever fits you best—no “wrong” choices here. I had a blast experimenting until I found my favorites.\r\n\r\nBoss fights are fantastic. Each one is introduced with flair and handled with care. Their patterns are clear and fair, making each attempt feel like real progress. They hit hard, but with practice, they’re absolutely beatable—and that’s what makes them so satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle elements are smart and engaging. They break up the action without slowing the pace, and they feel meaningful—not just filler.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite aspects was the atmosphere. Every area feels distinct, with stunning steampunk aesthetics and eerie, immersive design. The way the game transitions between zones keeps things fresh while maintaining a cohesive world.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another highlight. There’s a rich collection of music, from background ambience to emotional character themes—and even collectible tracks you can play in-game. It adds a lot of soul to an already beautiful world.\r\n\r\nOn the technical side: flawless. No crashes, no bugs, no frame drops. In a genre known for punishing gameplay, it’s a blessing not to have to fight the system itself.\r\n\r\nFinally, the lie/truth mechanic is brilliant. Throughout the game, you make meaningful choices that shape not just the ending, but how you view the characters around you. Their side stories are compelling and sometimes tragic—and your decisions have real weight.\r\n\r\nIf you’re into Soulslikes or dark fantasy stories with emotional depth, Lies of P is a must-play.

Or multihits.  Or both.  Or maybe they're really fast?  Sometimes they'll run from you, other times they'll never stop running you down.  Not every enemy is the most terrible to fight ever, but your patience will run thinner than their healthbars if you don't play every encounter perfectly.  But hey, enemy encounters are one thing, and a bad enemy can be sprinted past at the end of the day.  Soulslikes are renowned for their bosses nowadays, so what of the bosses?\r\n\r\nRest in pieces the massive text walls I had here detailing every boss in the DLC, for I was 9,281 characters too long.  Trust me when I say all of them aside from one (Anguished Guardian of the Ruins) is bad, and another that isn't the final boss (Lumacchio) is VERY bad.\r\n\r\nArlecchino.  Ooooh, Arlecchino.\r\n\r\nNothing compares.  Boasting an utterly ridiculous amount of health, hyperaggression that makes you wonder if he's a rabid dog more than sentient puppet, attack chains that will make you wonder if you're a common enemy being assaulted by the real player this time, and so, so much more.  Where do I even begin, the fact he can gapclose effortlessly to start ripping you a new one with his fast and shockingly painful combos?  Maybe the fact he's so restless, you'll once again be getting one clean hit before anything more is a risk of losing your limbs to his wild slashing.  Maybe the fact he can choose to extend combos at will...ooh, there's a good one!  He can READ YOUR INPUTS, AND EXTEND ALMOST ANY OF HIS ATTACK CHAINS TO PUNISH YOU BEFORE THE HEAL GOES OFF.  FROM QUITE A DISTANCE.  To those who scoffed at Elden Ring's artificial difficulty via input reading (Looking at Godskins tossing fireballs every time your flask is raised), I raise you a new level of tragically unfair.  It reduces your healing opportunities to once in a blue moon, either if he's halfway across the arena of his own choice or you have just barely enough distance to raise your guard when he goes for the punish.  His tracking and multihits are also so obscene that pressing B is completely redundant, so forget everything you ever learned about dodging and just perfect guard everything.  Its your only hope before he...\r\n\r\nPhase 2.  He opens the fight with an absolute lightshow of crushing your hopes of this DLC being worth your sanity, let alone your money, by blending you with a 20+ hit combo filled with projectiles, fury attacks (perfect guard OR ELSE), and...unblockables.  That's right, remember how to dodge his attacks every so often or else you'll find that the intended way to handle phase 1 is no longer intended to carry over.  Now bearing possibly the most infuriating SPECIAL status in the game, Break - lowering the HP you can recover if so much as 1% of the meter is filled - on over half of his possible attacks, you need to do this fight essentially hitless.  Fighting both your rapidly declining healthbar and the Break status watering down any rare chance you get to heal, Arlecchino makes a full 110% effort to remind you he's going to use you to scrub his dishes when he's done with you.  That incredibly absurd opening attack happens TWICE, by the way.  Stack this all on top of how far he reaches, being able to attack behind him should you linger for more than half a second, once again extending his combos to 10+ swings if he so chooses, and some really absurd timings that demand immaculate hand-eye coordination that ALSO defeats rolling anything but his unblockables, I cannot fathom who playtested this boss.  At no point in my 4+ hours did I enjoy fighting him, and even turning the game to the newly implemented easiest difficulty had me gritting my teeth and closing the fight out with no healing left and roughly two hits from kicking the bucket.  So much of his difficulty is artificial nonsense, from demanding perfect gameplay to removing playstyles to - I can't even IMAGINE how any mid-tier weapons fare against him.  I'd played a heavy portion of the DLC using the Seven-Coil Spring Sword, an old masterclass of a weapon and likely the 3rd best in the entire game.  Even using such a powerful and multi-faceted weapon I was scraping the bottom of the barrel for attack opportunities and worthwhile damage.  I don't think any boss, in any game, for the rest of my life, will ever come close to scarring me quite like Arlecchino did.  That puppet broke me mentally worse than Venigni, and he lost his parents to the guy.  What a class act.\r\n\r\nOh, and he laughs hysterically at you the whole time.  It gets to you after awhile, being mocked every second you're being mollywhopped by a mechanical superweapon.\r\n\r\n...Now, I get it.  NG+5 is no small feat, being literally the highest difficulty the game can offer.  It wasn't always like this though - on the SAME DAY as the DLC released, the patch increased the difficulty for NG+4 and onwards (+5 being the max anyhow), which seems to have tossed far too much spice into the DLC.  Having done all but Arlecchino on max difficulty however, I believe the problems extend well beyond the damage and health they bear - the attacks just aren't fun.  So much of the fights will be spent observing the most bloodthirsty attack patterns in any soulslike out there, demanding you to react to each and every swing with near-perfect timing.  The developers have officially released a statement that they'll be patching the DLC and reducing the difficulty, so beating it was actually a bit of a rush for me.  Heavens forbid I play it when they've \"fixed\" it - and that's why we're here, writing this.  Their ambitions became far too grand, and they have created an utter monstrosity of \"gameplay design\" that defeats the purpose of enjoying the game.  Its hard to enjoy the ending when all I can think about is how even tuning the difficulty to the lowest I could while playing my heart out still resulted in a feeble struggle that felt brutal and unwarranted the whole way.  They can tweak numbers, but movesets?  That's a whole different story.  Sure, they can EVENTUALLY reduce the numbers to the point that the bosses keel over in record time and their weapons are made of play-doh, but their movesets and mechanics are so offensively artificially challenging that it begs how they got through this themselves.  It is a damned shame I was unable to enjoy this DLC on release...not because it was buggy, or unfinished, rushed, anything like that...but because it was unfair.\r\n\r\nOh, and they revoked my 100% completion by adding DLC achievements.  So killing the final boss was not for the story, or even for the satisfaction.  I've nobody to gloat to, not even you, dear reader.  I don't want to.\r\n\r\nI just wanted my damn 100% completion trophy back.  Now that I have it, I'm going to lie down...and think of a better soulslike.\r\n\r\n2/10.\r\n\r\nGoodnight, Krat City.

I think this game is the combination of all the 'soulslike' (a bad term, as if God of war 2018 was released today it would be called a souls like).\n\nIts level designs is similar to nioh, and that game was just annoying with its levels, and this game while it improves on that, is somewhat equally as annoying, I blame dark souls 1 for having one too many suprise attacks, and then suddenly souls like games always just have an enemy in the corner to attack you whenever you move forward, its gets old real quick and its lazy. I like that the levels connect somewhat, whereas Nioh its a singular level.\n\nThe game feels slightly unoriginal but that isnt a complaint at all, I mean it really does feel like sekiro and a little bit like Bloodborne, I really like the guarding system, and I think its done really well done and with being able to heal with attack is good, it keep you close to your enemy and its somewhat like a dance but not nearly like sekiro was. I cant really express it but the bosses just work, the combination of guarding and perhaps a dodge to get more hits then if you were to guard is amazing, and the bosses are great, I really have no complaints with the bosses, perhaps with the design of a few like Victor who just looks dumb and looks like a big goon from a batman game, also Simon Manus who I guess made a custom big hat for when got big.\n\nThe weapon breaking system is great, durability is great and works and isnt annoying, the sekiro style arm I didnt really explore, the elemental weakness is simple and effective. The weapon creation is whatever tbh either a weapon works and its better than its original design or its much worse.\n\nI will definitely replay it at some point as I wish to do an Advance elemental run. Also it actually does NPC fights well, though I would get rid of backstabbing them except in the black rabbit botherhood fight.\n\nI think this Game can only ever be good as the ones that come before it, I think it needs something more, just a shove into something new, I dont know what that is, I wouldnt have a clue and if the developers cant think of something concrete that would it improve the sequel or a further dlc theres no point. But when I was fighting Walker of Illusions, I was thinking, while this is fun, this is their version of Pontiff from DS3, the enemy summons a weak version and there is just two of them.\n\nEdit.

Even when you manage to power through and get an opening, most weapons feel needlessly slow and uncomfortable to use even if said weapon is just a small police baton or a regular sword creating an annoying air of sluggishness that feels at odds with the games overall pacing.\n\nPast the main combat mechanics, the level design of the game makes everything worse by somehow being astronomically worse than the pits of Dark Souls 2's rushed design in areas like Iron Keep and on par, or arguably worse, than games of poor design like Code Vein. Each area in this game is a gauntlet of enemy after enemy after enemy with many cheap placements where a guy will be completely hidden behind a corner only to attack you the instant you walk by, or if the developers were feeling creative an enemy jumps down from the roof or out of a door or window. Almost every arena in the game makes me reconsider the naming of the game, as Snores of P seems much more accurate since every little fucker is sleeping in some random corner on standby just to ambush you when you start fighting another enemy that is conveniently highlighted by dramatic lighting which disappears due to the noticeably short shadow draw distance.\n\nOverall Lies of P is just a slog that feels pointless to have even been made as a $60 product. There are no real steps to polish the core gameplay formula of the general souls game design, nor does the game iterate on anything as it's no more than Dark Souls with a wannabe Sekiro parry in a steampunk Victorian setting that ends up grating my ears with its generic English anime dub voice acting.

The challenge is knowing when you are allowed to talk. \n\nWith that analogy what frustrates me is that a lot of enemies/bosses never stops talking, or they talk. very. slooooowww... and you cannot do anything about it you just parry dodge and pray that you can keep them shut-up on your turn.

Please prepare to charge up and complete a heavy attack so they actually break. Didn't make it in 5 seconds because their combo lasts for 3 and your build up takes another 2 seconds? Just start from the beginning lol.\n\nBy the way, here is your reward for gitting gud, charging your fable will allow you to start a fable attack. Nice, you earned it champ. Excuse me? You actually want to use it on your enemy? Good look, a single regular attack will break your combo. But rage attacks of enemies? Oh no, you can't block or interrupt those once their started. Just. Git. Gud.\n\nHow to git gud? Start doing perfect guards! Got one? Hell yeah, here are 3 more of them you better get them all right. The timing windows might be a bit narrow, and 30% of the attacks are weirdly delayed, but you will learn eventually. \n\nMovements and hit boxes are all over the place.

This game perfectly combines the \"dark souls\" roll and the Sekiro parry into one of the most satisfying combat systems I've ever played. The boss designs and atmosphere are absolutely incredible my favorites being Laxasia the complete and Nameless Puppet who will both go down as some of my favorite bosses in any souls game. If the combat and gameplay weren't enough Lies of P has a phenomenal story. While most other games in this genre make you look for the story yourself through cryptic item descriptions and obscure side quests Lies of P has you actually playing through the story itself and driving it forward as you play. Personally I think this is a breath of fresh air in the souls genre especially since all the characters are so well written and the story is told so perfectly. Although I felt the game had a bit of a rocky start and a few bumps through it the story is honestly what kept me playing. Sometimes level design felt repetitive and at times it felt like a lot of the difficultly I was having was due to enemy spam rather than an actual hard fight. Nevertheless this game far exceeded the expectations I had when I bought it and deserves the glaze I gave it.

Unless you like having your entire save file disappearing. Logged in to see my initial save file of around an hour had disappeared, and after turning to google and reddit I have yet to find a fix.\n     Many others have the same issue I did, spanning all the way back to the games release, although it seems the disappearing save files have rapidly increased in occurrences after the recent DLCs release, which is unfortunately when I decided to buy the game.\n     I want to love this game, with hundreds of hours on Elden Ring spread across playstation and xbox consoles, I respect and appreciate all the similarities and differences in each title. Lies of Ps setting and style is amazing, and I find the combat to be very smooth (so far, only played for an hour before taking a little break) but under some discussions on the games steam page another player mentions the developers have not released any statement regarding the issue, which is very disappointing. I see no point in playing this amazingly interesting and challenging game at all, as seemingly your save file can disappear at any time.\n\nEdit; Ok so I think I have narrowed down the cause of the issue, when leaving the game it gives you 2 options, \"exit to title screen\" or \"exit to desktop.\" Anyone unfortunate enough to press \"exit to desktop\" option can kiss their entire characters progress goodbye, no matter how far you have progressed through the story. So you could be right before the final boss and for whatever reason decide to finish later, but when exiting the game you make a small, simple, innocent little mistake and click a wrong button, and now you have just screwed yourself.

I'll get to that in one of the cons but... pro and con time!\n\nPro 1: IF your a Lies of P fan like I am (Though word of warning partway through this DLC I turned the difficulty down to the easiest Difficulty with the difficulty update mainly since I have a large backlog of games and don't want to ram my head against a brick wall of Bosses in Overture for weeks that have no help in many of them like summons... only two have summons and 1 has an Ally you can help recover so the final boss battle of the story and that is about it... mainly its you VS many bosses and while many solo bosses in Overture... so yeah I have a Get Gud skill issue thing with parries but I'm GLAD I turned the difficulty down for Lumacchio or whoever that golden #$% of a boss is in Overture... three phases with him recovering each time... but I'll get to that in a con later... for now... Con 1!\n\nCon 1: BARELY any summon-able help... in Overture... for Lies of P there are bosses that are able to have MANY summons and as you may have guessed this is a combined review of Lies of P and its Overture DLC... anyway for MANY of the bosses in Lies of P you can get summoned help so your not steamrolled by the bosses... I played and beat the entire Lies of P story on the hardest difficulty or the default difficulty before the Overture DLC came out and boy I can tell you the difficulty select helped IMMENSELY... again... skill issue on my end I know but when your mainly focused on Guarding and stuff from games like Elden ring and other Soul games with a shield mechanic... your parry game is not the best.... and yes I know there is Aegis but but I think when you run out of Legion energy until you get that legion regen perk, its a limited resource of a guard... could be wrong...\n\nPro 2: The Story... both Lies of P and Overture have serious Story moments though I'll get into Overture later... for Lies of P, again I beat the main story before Overture even came out so I'm not sure what Overture changed (if at all) in the main story... I may have to play NG+ to get some better clarity but given you help a lot of people... not sure how anyone you actually *save* in overture effects the main story of Lies of P... but the main story has you lie or tell the truth to decide if you want to be human or a puppet... *Here is a hint... Go lies all the way mainly for the Rise of P ending... you can also pet the cat as well which is worth the spoiler.*...\n\nCon 2: Lies of P and the Overture DLC REALLY give a new meaning to the phrase, NG+ exclusives... mainly the records... I haven't played the NG+ modes yet so I am missing out on some things like gold records and actually understanding what the puppets in Krat and other bosses are trying to say... mainly if you want a COMPLETE experience... go NG+ mode... for me that is not on the table right now... especially since I just beat Overture and I'm still confused on how this is a complete experience for Lies of P... does it effect the main game in any meaningful way?... do you get a fourth ending?... honestly not sure... finally Pros and con 3...\n\nPro 3: Perfomance... it is a VERY good game to play... I've played this game on Steam Deck OLED and now the Legion Go with Bazzite... I was able to play a steady 48 to 60 FPS *mainly on battery life saving reasons.* with lower TDP then you would think... and boy the game was smooth through the entire run of Overture... I could set 48, it would stick... if I raised the TDP use, could EASILY get 60 FPS or higher... so THIS game if you want a portable experience is the way to go compared to many Souls-like games.\n\nCon 3: Crashing.... had two crashes during my Lies of P run in the Overture DLC... nothing game breaking but figured I should let people know... thank Chaos for Autosaves... but know that you should use the checkpoints through the game WHEN POSSIBLE... you never know if the game may crash or something.\n\nAll in all Lies of P is a VERY good Soul-like game... for parry mains... I had to relearn how to parry, dodge, and more for Overture... it was not as fun as I expected from the confusing way the Story of the DLC happens... does it explain how Romeo died if he died?... did Lea die?... the ending implicates that BIG time but we never know... honestly once you play Overture after you hit chapter 9 you may have a better experience like I did since I beat the game already and never did an NG+ run for MANY reasons... all in all if you want to play the full package... you can... but I consider Overture FOR NOW a good dessert to a nice hearty meal that the game Lies of P's main game is... extra but not exactly needed... has nice weapons though but a serious lack of elemental based weapons... I liked the flamethrower like spear weapon for MANY of the Overture regions which have Carcass enemy types mainly or Puppet enemies... also BIG warning... $%^& the crocodile boss an all it stands for... that grab attack is WAY too homed in and the attacks I should have dodged for some bosses... I couldn't... so again... this game is Parry central with a dash of block and dodge... not my forte but you can beat the game if you work hard enough to do so... my playtime is not a joke... all in all got nearly 100 hours in this game and it shows.", "timestamp_created": 1749666000, "timestamp_updated": 1749666000, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}

So let's talk about Lies of P.\n\nThis game is truly magnificent, it's rare to see a product so refined and well-crafted, from a studio inexperienced with the genre, that it can rival even the makers of the genre itself. Be it the amazing level design, the rich combat akin to Sekiro and Bloodborne or the innovations to bot QOL and the base loop.\n\nNow this game will not be for every Fromsoftware fan, if your favorite is one of the earlier games (Demon's souls, Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2) and you find the new games to be significantly worse or outright bad, look for a different game. Lies of P takes the boss and combat centric design with simplier worlds of the later games and cranks them up to 11.\n\nLies of P is a linear game, not everybody will like it, but it allowed the developers to make the game very well balanced just like Fromsoftware did with Dark Souls 3. While the levels are large with many shorcuts, the game itself has levels strictly one after another.\n\nNow to the best part, the combat. By that I don't just mean the fighting itself, but also how they helped refine the formula by introducing rechargable heals, changed durability and of course added the wholee \"make your own weapons\" thing, all of which are excellent. \n\nLies of P also introduces many QOL changes, my favorite being indicators of quest progression and Souls (Ergo in Lies of P) spawning in front of boss gates.\n\nIf I have to say some gripes with the game, I wish some items would be buyable infinitely in the endgame (like special weapon upgrade mats) and the performance significantly worsened after DLC released, I experienced many crashes throuout my DLC playthrough, even on a lower settings, when before I never even stuttered, hopefully this gets patched soon.\n\nIn conclussion, Lies of P is a must have for any modern Fromsoftware fan, it expertly innovated the genre in some aspects and improved in a few even. If somebody told me this is made by Fromsoftware themself, I would most likely believe them and that is the highest praise I think a souls-like can garner.", "timestamp_created": 1749663755, "timestamp_updated": 1749663755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

It is just difficult to master due to the nature of the game's difficulty and rhythmic timing mechanics (as is typical of games within the genre this is in)\n-- No microtransactions that flood so many games of this generation... Yet this stands out by not relying on such tactics. Instead they just make a good game with a lot of enjoyable aspects and soul.\n-- This game has phenomenal work in regards to it's music and original soundtracks. The game also includes a gramophone to showcase that as you unlock them which is a cool side feature if you have any interest.\n-- This game is VERY well optimized. This game is not intended to be insanely high tech in visuals. It is meant to be more light, but focused on art style with its steampunk aesthetics.

I would put it on par with Sekiro in terms of pure quality and quantity. \n\nThe game play is exciting, rewarding and challenging all the way through. The durability, parry, crafting and countless other combat-centric systems keep combat from ever getting stale and make building around your play-style simple. One of my favorite additions is the re-spec being available relatively early on and being costly but unlimited. This is a no-brainer for souls as a series and it baffles me how other games miss out on this as a feature. \n\nThe graphics are really decent. I have a crappy gamer laptop and in spite of that I am able to run the game at decent graphics settings with little to no issue. The game's more stylized approach helps this a ton, as it's semi-realistic fairy tale aesthetic has really captured my fancy, though I could see how others would find it a little silly at times. One aspect of this design I found particularly interesting were the mask designs and how they gave certain characters a distinct feel and character to them in spite of not having the benefit of facial expression.\n\nThe music I have found to be super catchy and dynamic. There are some tracks in this game I would not be surprised to here in a cafe, ballroom, arena or funeral, all while still capturing that morose yet bittersweet tone. \"Stage of Grief\" and a certain memory-based song I found to be my favorites. \n\nThe story I found to be surprisingly solid. What I think really helps the game is that it never forces the player to engage with a majority of it, yet has a decently complex and structurally solid plot that really hits that Isaac Asimov and Dark Souls thematic synthesis. I found a certain subtitle-based trick that you can either deduce yourself or decipher later with an item to be a unique and interesting way to pay off story beats. \n\nI will levy one criticism of the game. It is mainly that I believe some of the Souls-brand tricks and gimmicks it puts in some of its levels to be more to its detriment. An over-reliance on Decay and the good-old fashioned ambush is used a little to often for my tastes. \n\nBut overall I would say subjectively this is exactly what I want from Souls-style games from hereon, this kind of creativity and effort should be rewarded more often in this industry.

Menus are responsive and clear. Attributes are well explained and there are a lot of quality of life elements that helps you keep track of quests. Pretty unprecedented for a soulslike. The sound design really makes the atmosphere pop and the songs are melancholic which corroborates for moody tone of the game. \r\nThe animations are excellent - this will make or break this kind of game and it was delightful seeing how much attention and love was put into making the enemies' attacks feel powerful and telegraphed.\r\n\r\nLength 2/2\r\n20 hours to beat and I beat all optional content and got all collectibles. It ended on a good note. There´s a New Game + feature which is always welcome in this sort of game. \r\n\r\nStory: 1/2\r\nHuge surprise here. I enjoyed learning about this world and its characters. Lore collectibles are very written without being vague or being a wall of text that nobody will pause their gameplay to read. Voice acting really sells on the characters backstories and motivations. Some of the cast are hit and miss but overall we have a good supporting cast and a few complicated fellows that will make you second guess their speech and their true ideals.\r\n\r\nGameplay: 2/2\r\nAnother surprise. This is the first non-FromSoftware soulslike I managed to beat all the way. Combat is fluid and very punishing if you're underestimate your enemies and do not pay attention to your surroundings. The star of the show here is the parry mechanic, which generates this juicy risk-reward feedback loop that will make you want to study the enemy moveset in order to beat them in style.\r\nWe have a good implementation of the rally mechanic from Bloodborne if you block normally - good way to incentivize aggression amidst the harrowing feeling of being overwhelmed by a flurry of attacks.\r\nWe also have a clever twist on the healing mechanic. The estus flask of this game now will replenish back from zero to 1 charge if you land attacks on enemies. Pinocchio is not as nimble as the hunter from Bloodborne, but the devs here sure want you to be on top of enemies landing blows.\r\nThere´s a very decent enemy and boss variety, the upgrade system is easy to understand and they are very generous with respecs and skill resets, giving a lot of room for build experimentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLasting Appeal: 1/2\r\nIf my backlog was shorter I'd love to run NG+. The DLC just released so I'll revisit this game soon.\r\n\r\nUniqueness: 1/2\r\nWhen I picked up this game in a sale, I never thought I'd be giving a game so heavily inspired by FromSoftware's masterpieces. But here we are. We have easy to follow questlines, non-cryptic story progression and the character's speech makes sense for a change. We have a very good mix of elements that are so well implemented that make Lies of P stand on its own, without being a mere clone from the latest XXXX Souls.\r\n\r\nVerdict: 9/10\r\nI wasn't expecting to like it as much.

This tops Elden Ring, Dark Souls 1 + 2 and I think this is arguably better than Dark Souls 3. Just because a game has the Souls Like tag in the title. It doesn't mean the game has to be pulling out your hair in anguish and frustration. This game is definitely difficult yes, especially NG+1 onwards. The DLC is stupidly hard in NG+.\r\n\r\nThe story is clearly in front of you, you don't have to search under rocks to milk out bits of lore. You are playing a beautiful story with plot points you can indeed search for to fill in any gaps but if you go from Point A to Point B and straight to the end of the game you're still getting a cohesive story. \r\n\r\nThe music absolutely towers over any of the other Souls Like games I've played. It's less dark brass orchestras it's more of a thinned down composition with more vocals, accordion and strings. It's set in France which would make a lot of sense with the instrumental choice which also makes the game feel more 'Romantic?' I'm not sure how to put it but the music is by far S tier. I would beg anyone who's interested in what I'm saying to listen to the OST on youtube or something.\r\n\r\nCombat is extremely fun and fluid my only gripe with it is the annoying enemies such as DOGS. I FUCKING HATE DOGS. Or when you are running through loads of enemies and get cornered by FUCKING DOGS.\r\n\r\nBosses are fairly memorable with no gimmick bosses I'm aware of and arguably quite a few difficult ones that make the others look like generic enemies.\r\n\r\nI won't spoil anything in this review but I do urge everyone who reads this review and might be looking at getting this game to bite the bullet and please please please buy this game.

Other minor gripes, i think fable charges too slowly and legion mags don't refill enough. Levels look great but can feel pretty linear.

It explores some truly compelling themes, has incredibly well polished gameplay and an atmospheric world.[/h2]\r\n\r\n[h3]Exploring Humanity And Deception.[/h3]\r\nThe story in Lies of P explores some really interesting themes that work extremely well within the narrative of the game. Most notably, what truly defines a human and differs them from a machine (or a puppet) and the morality of lying. Your decisions about truth and deception will shape the game's outcome.\r\n\r\n[h3]Well Thought Out And Inspired Level Design[/h3]\r\nThe level design draws inspiration heavily from Dark Souls 1 and 3, combining tight, interconnected areas with clever shortcuts and layered exploration. It feels deliberate and rewarding, never wasting the player's time.\r\n\r\n[h3]Combat System Feels Incredible[/h3]\r\nCombat, in my opinion, is the standout feature. Once it \"clicks\", it starts to feel deeply satisfying. Weapon variety is impressive and almost every weapon in the game feels unique. On top of that you can also mix and match weapon blades and handles to build your own weapons. Fable Arts and Legion Arms are a unique and a really well thought out system to implement special abilities into the game. \r\n\r\n[h3]Memorable Bosses[/h3]\r\nThe bosses are some of the best in any soulslike/soulsborne game. They are creative, challenging and visually impressive. Nearly every fight feels memorable and thoughtfully designed.\r\n\r\n[h3]Accessible Quests[/h3]\r\nUnlike usually in soulslike/soulsborne games, Lies of P offers clear and manageable side quests. You can complete practically all of them without needing to look up a guide and yet none of them feel too easy or cheap, making exploration and NPC interactions more engaging.\r\n\r\n[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]\r\nLies of P isn't just a strong soulslike, it's one of the most complete and rewarding game experiences I've ever had.

It's not a matter of git good, but its impossible to progress through certain areas without avoiding everything or cheesing it with range.  \r\n\r\nIn the base game, when you come across an elite/stronger mob, its usually in the mano a mano context.  Or if there are trash mobs, you are able to dispatch of them fairly easily while navigating around the elite mob.  To summarize, you have a fighting chance -- and you generally prevail if you can learn the elite mob's attack patterns.\r\n\r\nThis is not the case in the DLC.  Instead, the levels in the DLC throw multiple mobs in your face in a limited arena to work with, along with multiple range units.  How about five dogs at once that can each individually stun lock you along with a couple of range mobs sniping you from afar?  Or what about 2 elite mobs with gap closers along many other trash mobs and range attackers?  \r\n\r\nBosses, lore, new weapons, etc. are all otherwise fine, but the content is very limited in light of the $30 pricetag.

However, when I played through it AND the DLC that released recently, this ended up becoming one of my favorite games of all time. It's story, world, characters, and even its gameplay are all wonderful. I am SHOCKED this game isn't getting more attention than it has, even though it has quite a fairly decently sized audience. \n     I am aware there is going to be a Wizard of Oz inspired game that was teased by the base game, and if this game is a testament to what is going to come (given this game takes stuff from the Pinocchio stories heavily), you bet I will be playing that too.\nOnly criticism I will give is that the main antagonist of the base-game is pretty... shallow. We do learn more about him in the dlc that led to the events of the base-game, but he is kind of just \"okay.\" The DLC ANTAGONIST ON THE OTHER HAND...

To make matters worse, most enemy attacks, bosses included, are your typical Elden-Ring-like delay-into-two-frame-long-swing.\n\nThis makes learning patterns absolutely miserable, because you physically CANNOT parry by reaction alone. You HAVE to get hit and die over and over again until you've fully internalized the precise attack timing so you can parry it reliably. And of course bosses are health sponges, hit like a truck, and have 3 phases because of course they do.\n\nI'm tired of soulslike devs looking at From Software's works, copying everything they do on a surface level, thinking making their game difficult is enough to make it good, while completely missing how all of the puzzle pieces are supposed to fit together to make an actually good game.", "timestamp_created": 1749502789, "timestamp_updated": 1749502789, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519010305404663086", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Coincidentally, it was the exact same day that the Overture DLC dropped so it was perfect timing & I'm super hyped for the DLC content. \r\n\r\nHere's my full thoughts about Lies of P as a whole game (obviously excluding DLC since I've yet to play). This game is objectively amazing. It is a work of true art. Neowiz & Round 8 were able to capture the essence of a proper, high quality Souls like game perfectly. This game is quite challenging I will absolutely admit that. There are parts of the game I really enjoy & parts of the game I still absolutely hate to this day. However, I rate this game very high on my list of Souls/Souls likes regardless. \r\n\r\nThe interesting thing about Lies of P is that at the very beginning, you will struggle, you will fail, you will suffer. It is expected for you to get your a** kicked. Just know that you will overcome all challenges & win. You will defeat those bosses & show them you are not to be messed with. This game has a mechanic called the \"P Organ\" which you upgrade & improve your character's strength. Something I discovered recently is that after you play through the game enough times while struggling, the P Organ will reward you by having some INCREDIBLE abilities you can unlock that makes the game so much more manageable. The only downside is that you have to replay the game on NG+1 & NG+2. However, this isn't that bad since you'll want to do that anyways to achieve 100% Steam achievements. \r\n\r\nWith the release of the Overture DLC, new difficulty options are available for those who do not want to experience the default punishing difficulty of this game. This means this game is now extremely accessible & playable for anyone & everyone out there. For anyone who is interested in Souls/Souls like games, definitely consider this game, even if it's your very 1st Souls/Souls like game. This game has a Lovecraftian & perhaps slight Eldritch horror vibe to it with the world design. If you enjoy those types of genres, you will love this game. \r\n\r\nLast but not least, I would say that Lies of P is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite Souls/Souls like game of all time behind Sekiro Shadows Die Twice. I'm not yet sure whether I like either Dark Souls 3 or Elden Ring more or less than Lies of P, but I'd probably say that the only game which may take 2nd place above Lies of P would be Elden Ring. Number wise, I'd give Lies of P a solid 8/10 rating. Also, Lies of P is far superior to Bloodborne because the latter game is locked behind a stupid waste of money console & only plays at 30 FPS so it's automatically worse. It is what it is. \r\n\r\nFinal verdict: highly recommend, everyone go play Lies of P. I am so eager to start Overture. I will likely update this review or create a new one after I finish beating all of the Overture DLC.

Finished all the bosses in the base game on the max difficulty without summons (except for the first one, summoned to check them and actually killed it lol) and items. Music is great, graphics are great. The only cons to me is non-open world but that's personal. Parry. PARRY. Unlike clunky elden ring parries the ones here are super great. Dodges kinda idk, didn't click with me, but parries man. Killing a boss with 0 damage while parrying every attack just feels really good. Also don't forget most of the stuff in elden ring can't be parried and being able to survive giant's roll by doding into it is kinda lmfao.\r\n\r\nWay way and way better to me than dark souls 3, just personal.\r\n\r\nIdk why some people are saying this game is harder than elden ring imo it is way easier (if you are playing both games without summons / items). Typical elden ring boss: cast huge aoe from 999m, few more, then fly away before you get to it, repeat. Also some super crazy melee combo that you have to dodge and then hit a boss for 1 or 2 times. And yeah some stuff input reading you trying to use heal... Don't forget about grab attacks too and did I also mentioned you can't parry most of the stuff? Also you like dragons? Cuz man camera above em is really funny. Also I hope you like same bosses but with more hp and even more aoe attacks. Also you like trees?\r\n\r\nIn this game bosses will patiently wait for you to do something for like 5 seconds after doing their combo. You can block/parry almost every attack and if you block something then you can hit your enemy to recover hp back which is kinda op tbh. Still, a few grab attacks for the entire game, some annoying aoe stuff but nothing fancy or hard. And still some bosses have weird camera angle and a bit hard to tell what is about to happen. Still managable and mkay. Some bosses like in elden ring really love to spam their attack but there is a huge difference. If you parry their attacks you can stagger your enemy then land charged attack to poise break it and then do a critical for some huge damage. You can literally ignore attacking boss and just parry-crit hit and still have some great fun. But still, kinda typical boss fight is: parry everything -> charge attack -> repeat. I think if I tried to use summons, items and different weapons based on the boss weakness it would be like super tutorial easy game.\r\n\r\nWill def play NG+ and get DLC when I stop being greedy.

That’s the question I’ve been asking myself for hours. Lies of P has officially become one of my favorite games. I didn’t want to rush this review—I wanted to beat the DLC first, get my 100% back, and let everything settle. After all that, one thing is clear: I love this game with every cell of my heart.\n\nLies of P is a dark reinterpretation of the classic Pinocchio tale, set in our beloved, beautiful city of Krat. The game is often compared to Bloodborne, but it’s not just a Bloodborne-like. It’s a great experience that stands proudly on its own.\n\nAt its core, Lies of P nails what makes the Souls-like genre so satisfying. The combat is rewardingly punishing. Every weapon feels impactful, and the Legion Arm system adds a unique twist that opens up room for new strategies. Whether you prefer aggressive playstyles or methodical parrying (WHICH IS EXTREMELY HARD IN THIS GAME), there’s something here for every type of player.\n\nMy story of beating the game 100% is kinda fun because I did all that on one slot (and so I was a bit overpowered).\nI want to mention a few of my favorite weapons and which Legion Arms I used.\nAzure Dragon Crescent Glaive was my main(HM: Monad's Rose Sword). Its damage and swing speed were nearly perfect for what I wanted. My playstyle was all about dexterity… (oh, my bad—I meant technique). At first, I was a complete loser at parrying attacks, but then I started to grow stronger and developed my own “Legendary Stalker” style, where I managed to combine both.\n\nBoss fights are another standout. Each one is a cinematic, challenging experience that demands precision and patience. The difficulty is tough but fair—every death teaches you something new. Of course, some bosses were copied straight from other games, like Nameless Puppet and Lady Maria from Bloodborne, but hey, that doesn’t take away the joyful taste of victory.\n\nI didn’t expect the story to hit me so hard. The mystery surrounding Carlo and P, Romeo, and Geppetto (absolutely hate this bastard of a father) unraveled slowly, pulling me deeper with every revelation. I felt so sad on my second and third playthroughs, knowing I must kill my once-best friend Romeo, who was simply trying to stop me. The story narrative is layered with moral choices and undertones about humanity, lies, and the afterlife.\n\n“People have no idea so many secrets are buried in Krat…” — Antonia\n\nKrat is more than just a backdrop—it’s a character of its own. The art direction is absolutely phenomenal. The gothic-industrial setting of the 19th century, reminiscent of Bloodborne but with its own identity, is visually striking and full of subtle environmental storytelling. You can literally feel the petrification disease flowing through the air.\n\nA few of my favorite locations are Estella Opera House and Carnival Garden. I have an overall obsession with winter locations because there’s a natural beauty in them I simply can’t resist (shall I remind you of the Painted World of Ariandel??).\n\nThe OST is easily one of the best in all of gaming. Period. Every track fits perfectly—from haunting melodies to pulse-pounding boss themes. It’s rare for a soundtrack to elevate a game this much, but here it’s integral to the emotional experience.\nMy favorite one is Far East Princess (BUT THAT DOESN’T MEAN THE OTHERS ARE BAD! I JUST LIKE THIS ONE A LITTLE BIT MORE!!).\n\nI made sure to beat the DLC before writing this review, and it was worth every second. It expands on the base game in meaningful ways—both narratively and gameplay-wise. The new bosses, weapons, and lore deepen the experience. I have to mention that the DLC is way bigger than I thought it would be. I expected two new locations and zero interesting bosses, and I was wrong!\nOf course, most of the bosses were easy, and there aren’t that many new mechanics in the game (I really loved them adding a bow—but why only one ranged weapon??).It feels like I still want more of it, more of this fascinating and encouraging journey.\n\nOne thing that absolutely blew me away is how Lies of P is extremely well optimized. Even on my aging NVIDIA Quadro 2200K, the game ran with some (BUT AT LEAST IT DID) lags. It still looked gorgeous and played like a dream, which says a lot about how well the devs polished this title. I can only imagine how breathtaking it will be once I upgrade my PC—I’m already planning a full replay just to experience Krat at max settings.\n\nOf course, every game has its drawbacks. In Lies of P, the replayability in terms of route variability is a bit limited. You go through most locations in a pretty fixed order, with only a few moments where you have some freedom. It’s not a sandbox or branching-path kind of game.\nBut here’s the thing—Elden Ring gave us an open world and, let’s be honest… it wasn’t always great. Huge doesn’t always mean better. I’d take tightly crafted, meaningful level design like the one in Dark Souls over empty open-world bloat any day.\n\nWe could sit here and talk pros and cons all day, sure—but that’s not what this review is for. I wrote this so that you’d go buy Lies of P and experience it yourself. You won’t regret it.\n\nLies of P isn’t just the best Soulslike out there—it’s a masterpiece in its own right. Every detail feels intentional. Every moment, memorable. It’s a labor of love, and it shows.\nAnd of course, I didn’t even mention a quarter of the things this game has to offer. There’s so much more—hidden lore, combat depth, secrets, side quests—but this review is already long enough, and let’s be real… most of you probably didn’t read this far anyway (lol).\n\nI’ll definitely be staying tuned for whatever the developers have in store next—if Lies of P is only the beginning, the future’s looking very bright for me.\n\nSo that’s all your Mohito had to say.\nHave fun playing the game, folks.", "timestamp_created": 1749385935, "timestamp_updated": 1749418333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

I just wished that combat was a bit more fluid instead of calculated. what I mean by that is when you press LB to block it doesn't override your attack and go straight into a block stand meaning you'll have to time your blocks more accurately in order to get perfect guards, it also means that if you attack at the wrong moment you'll be open to getting hit and there's no way to cancel the attack, therefore you must take a calculated approach to combat. Still, it is a lot of fun and the NPC's have immense personalities engaging with them is enlightening and you'd want to hear their stories, which makes you want to do any side quest even if they contribute very little to the overall progression of the game or your character. The story itself doesn't have much depth but because the NPC'S have so much life and relatable content to share it feels enormous and refreshing. definitely would recommend there must be some aspects you'd like as a player. Lastly the levels are simple and easy to remember, since there's no mini-map it works and boss fights always surprise you, they don't have strict move patterns they follow and can sometimes feel as though they are adjusting to your play style therefore you'd have no choice but to constantly change your approach to the situation and try new things whether its a new weapon, legion arm or dodge or block more.", "timestamp_created": 1749341839, "timestamp_updated": 1749341839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 0, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0.5, "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": true}

This game brings its own fresh spins and has its own identity while also wearing its inspirations proudly on its sleeves.  With a punchy fast combat system that combines the best of Bloodborne and Sekiro, and an unparalleled steampunk art direction.  This game has the nostalgic whimsy of a theme park whilst still retaining the beloved dark fantasy elements and cosmic horror we've come to love from the souls series.  I'm so excited to play the DLC when i get a chance to purchase it but even the base game alone I can more than recommend.\n\nNo game is perfect however, like the ancient catholic monks who sewed imperfections into their tapestries, there are some nitpicks and gripes i have with this game.\n\nNumber 1: FUCK Gemini, super annoying character, cringey as fuck voice acting and dialouge.  I get that it's pinnochio and he has to be there but man was he just too marvely for this game.\n\nNumber 2: Boss weapons have zero interactions with the weapon assembly system, which is a dam shame because making your own weapons is sick as fuck but the boss weapons are also sick as fuck and not being able to combine them to my liking felt like a letdown where I had to sacrifice one cool thing for another.\n\nNumber 3: Very Linear level design.  This game is very Dark Souls 3 in its approach to progression.  At least it does wrap around itself in some ways, but there's no room for sequence breaking or choosing your own path you just kinda go from one zone to the next.  I like my souls games to have a little bit of exploration and this game is severly lacking it.\n\nNumber 4: no multiplayer of any kind.  No co-op, no invasions, not even an arena mode.  I was hoping the DLC would introduce that but sadly i have not heard any news of that.  I'm of the minority here in that I love souls pvp and I think co-op is occasionally fun.  It's not a dealbreaker at all and I don't think it's entirely reasonable of me to want a debut souls title from a smaller studio to have full multiplayer support but its abscense does give me slightly less reason to come back every so often.", "timestamp_created": 1749331953, "timestamp_updated": 1749331953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}

Lies of P feels like a way fairer game to me, still quite hard mind you, but way more fair and player friendly. It's way easier to try different builds in this game, because respeccing is very cheap, and just requires a resource that you get over time for free. But even then, most weapons, except special weapons, are made of a handle part, and a blade part, which you can combine in any ways you want, and you only need to upgrade the blade part to do more damage. This makes it so you can experiment way more with more of the items you find, without feeling like you are wasting your time. (compared to Elden Ring) Also the story in this game is quite good, and the dlc makes it even better! The only bad thing I have to say about this game, is that the current scaling in the dlc (when playing on ng+ at least) feels like it is a bit off. The enemies have too much health and damage when compared to the the base game. I have only experienced it on ng+, so I can't speak of how the scaling is on a regular playthrough. They have added two \"easy modes\" in the new patch though, so if you think the dlc is too much you can at least turn down the difficulity, which is a good option if they want to be able to make the game really hard as a base. \r\n\r\nTLDR: Lies of PEAK", "timestamp_created": 1749872315, "timestamp_updated": 1749872315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "primarily_steam_deck": false}
